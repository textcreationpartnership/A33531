            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL who hold the Chriſtian Faith, do beleeve that as the world had a beginning, and was a created ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; ſo it ſhall periſh and come to an end (or be changed;) we ſeem not only to be on the laſt foot of time in this our Generation, but having ſtood 1650. years upon it, we have many thoughts of heart-long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for the glorious appearing of the Son of God; Many expect him viſibly to raign here on Earth in perſon, and that he ſhall be glorified even where he was crucified: Others look for a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Righteouſneſs, a wonderful light of Truth to be manifeſted, glorious out-breaking glympſes and appearances of the infinite wiſdom, the brightneſs and evidence of which ſhall ſcatter all thoſe clouds, and diſpell all thoſe Exhalations which have miſ-led us in the walkings of Chriſtianity, the falſe Prophets, Clouds without rain, and Fires without heat, which have appeared amongſt us: A people in this Nation hath had as great teſtimonies of this as any people extant on the Earth. The Power of the Almighty hath viſibly appeared here theſe many years, ſcattering of Truths, and revealing hard ſayings, and giving to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand things that were hid for many Generations, though according to the wiſdom of the Father he hath diſpenſed divers gifts, and that there is much of controverſie among us; yet if all be really for Chriſt, and the increaſe of his Kingdom, what matters it? Let but all this move and incourage each in his place faithfully to labour in the Vineyard of the Lord. The Maſter is expected; how he will come, lets not wrangle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, nor with whom: Let's all high and low, as we profeſs to expect his coming, ſo prepare for it: Aſſuredly he will then come to us in his glory, or take us to his glory: Therefore all you that in ſincerity profeſs Chriſtianity, rowze up your ſelves, liſten to the call of the Lord; He hath call'd afar off in <hi>Germany,</hi> he hath call'd at home, both here and in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> hear his voyce, prepare to meet the Lord your glory. Hitherto Chriſtians have been the ſhame of Chriſtianity, and Goſpellers the ſcandal of the Goſpel. There was a fatall and general Apoſtacy faln upon her who called her ſelf the Spouſe of Chriſt; ſhe as <hi>Aholah</hi> &amp; <hi>Aho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libah</hi> played the Harlot; and though ſhe here with us in <hi>England</hi> promiſed to return, yet ſhe kept her Darlings ſtill; if ſhe parted with the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:105181:3"/> Adulterer, ſhe kept the <hi>Syrian;</hi> God will have no mixture with Idols: <hi>England</hi> hath long deſired a thorow Reformation: Let no man boggle at the work if another deſires more then as ſome of you did 20. or 30. years ſince: why may not God have revealed this to him, and cloſed thine eyes now, as well as he revealed his will formerly to thee, and ſhut the eyes of others. Heretofore God put mean men only upon the work, here and there one; now he hath put many and great men upon the work; and what ever ſpurs they have; yet Chriſtian, if they drive on Gods deſign, lay thy hand on thy mouth, and only admire how God brings things to paſs what he intends.</p>
                  <p>Some men are ſo rational, they can ſee nothing of providence; reaſon devours Religion, and they are afraid leſt they ſhould happily find, or be found of God in a way they expected not; they wholly truſt to reaſon, and will ſee and feel, or they will not beleeve.</p>
                  <p>Others are meerly ſenſual, and in the muddineſs of their temper fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſenſe only, becauſe reaſon is ſo various; as many opinions as men even in things not above us; This is the main <hi>baſis</hi> of Atheiſme; ſhun this <hi>Scylla</hi> and that <hi>Charybdis,</hi> and underſtand, All Gods wayes are not only prudential, but providential, and God aſſuredly ſpeaks both ways: He that improves providence to Luſt, Error, and Tranſgreſſion againſt the evident revealed will of God, is like him that becauſe he hears of Election, ſins at liberty, which is a mark of Rejection; He that in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things in ſtreights for God, his glory, his Truth and Laws, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Righteouſneſs, in ſimplicity eyes God with conſtant and fervent prayers, walking humbly and watchfully over himſelf, and all that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with him, ſpying what leads and miſleads, and ſearching all inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, caſts all away all but that of the Lord and his Righteouſneſs: Surely he is like him that hearing of Election, and not knowing who it is, yet beleeving not only the truth of it, but bleſſings appertaining to it, ſaith, I will ſeek if happily I may find, I will knock becauſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and ſuch are aſſured to enter life eternal.</p>
                  <p>Now all you that have in your eye the expectation of the glorious appearance of the Lord Chriſt in your ſeveral ſtations, Parliament, Princes and Nobles, Army, Judges, Officers, Magiſtrates, Rich men, Citizens, high and low, Rich and poor, one with another, deſpiſe not my weakneſs, inability, unworthineſs; eye not my life paſt or preſent, but look to what I ſay, and as you find it bearing the mark and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of fervent truth, accept it; if you doubt, labor ſatisfaction private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; if you ſpy an error, rebuke or inform me with Chriſtian wiſdom and ſobriety (my zeal for Gods cauſe, not ſelf-confidence, hath put me forth to the work) and I ſhall willingly learn, and bleſs-God that makes me know his will, yea though by my failings, ſo it may work to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his glory, and propagation of truth. <hi>Amen,</hi> So be it.</p>
                  <p>And firſt give me leave to ſpeak a word to you that have at preſent the Supremacy of Power, lay to heart theſe things: Firſt, that you are in Gods ſtead; Next that there are many vows upon the Nation for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Righteouſneſs, againſt the then, and ſtill continued unchriſtian, uncivil, nay inhumane dealings of man with man, as man with <hi>God,</hi> &amp;c. You ſtand in the eys of all, all your goings are marked, and all your fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings graven to Record: Publick neceſſities, your own conſciences and
<pb facs="tcp:105181:3"/> peoples complaints, have plucked forth Declarations to men, as well as Covenants to God; the Obligations to men are ſtill the ſame, if the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be the ſame: And for our Obligations wherein we lift up our hands to the moſt high God; truly though the Covenant (as is ſaid) be out of date, that is the end of the Covenant for ſatisfaction to the King, to draw him to an union and conjunction with his great Councel, be diſobliged; yet the ſeeking of the ſetling of this Nation, the three Nations, all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, according to the Rule of Righteouſneſs in love, peace, and unity, yea the drawing of them to uniformity, both in Doctrine and Diſcipline according to the Word of God (that is, by the evidence of truth and the manifeſtation of the Spirit) is ſtill the duty of all Chriſtians; for this had been a duty, had the Covenant never have been; it was before it, and muſt remain after.</p>
                  <p>The preſent Age is in the learned part very acute, at leaſt to cenſure all perſons, and then aſſuredly the actions of Enemies. You have many who foment jealouſies from the ſuppoſed Errings and delays, ſome to one end, ſome to another, but all of beleeving the old experimented Rule of the deſtructiveneſs of popular Government from the variety and inconſtancy, the dilatorineſs and ambiguouſneſs of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and unſatisfiedneſs of ſo many ſelfiſh Intereſts as are among them; this is to bring in the Government of a King again; Indeed multitude of occaſions makes your proceedings ſlow-paced. Inſtead of particular Acts which are unſatisfactory, ſettle a compleat body of Government; you have means of ſupplying all indigencies; for if you improve your power to evident publick good, who will oppoſe? The Royaliſt and all among the Parliament party agree in many juſt things, yet uneffected: Juſtice is the preſervation as foundation of the Throne. If you will raign ſafely, walk not in any of the wayes of them that fell before you; the preſident of their puniſhment, as their error is too nigh at hand: Let no intereſt deterr you from your Rule: Conſerve indeed the real Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the people, free us from all thoſe Legerdemains, the ſleights of Oppreſſion and Tyranny: What was unjuſt gain in the King, let not the State demand there; depend upon, &amp; follow providence as far as you will, and be as remiſs and ſo called merciful as you pleaſe; but in things juſt and evidently conducing to common good be ſevere and unalterable; this is righteous: In things difficult and doubtful, firſt uſe reaſon and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, diſcover the intereſt oppoſing, and ſo proceed to afflict; this wil breed both fear and love: Alter a good and juſt thing, though to a more juſt, by degrees, and gently; for intereſts have here lawful pleas; but in evidently evil, it's the glory to make ſpeed: Connive not there for an hour. What is here driven at, is the juſt Reformation of all our Laws, the Reduction of them to a Rule and ſtandard of Chriſtian Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity. You that are of the long Robe, both in and out of the houſe, you whoſe knowledge both divine and humane abounds, as your abilities in outward as inward excellencies, Judges, Councellors and Officers of all ſorts, look not at ancient Cuſtomes, but at the common Juſtice of them; not how they reſtrain particular evils, but as they conduce to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal good. If you will not admit the oppoſition of inferiors, do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but carrying that evidence of reaſon, as may ſtop the mouths of fools, as well as ſatisfie wiſe men: Let Godlineſs now in this light be
<pb facs="tcp:105181:4"/> the pretious gain; its the Pearl of great price: Surely there are things called Law, admitted practically for Law, and thoſe oppoſed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, which are ſo notoriouſly unjuſt and irrational, ſo deſtructive to the Nation, as its the admiration of all men they are not amended; 'tis laid onely to the charge as (a matter of Intereſt) to be obſtructors; ſee in the day the Lord oppoſing every evil thing; lay down Self, and God will ſtabliſh you. To you Princes and Nobles, I ſay, learn by Gods dealings with you, to ſee Thrones, and Scepters, Powers Civil and Military, Riches and Honors, Wiſdom and all, are the gifts of the Almighty Wiſdom: The Hand of Providence holds them forth, and diſpoſeth them as it pleaſeth: You have been bad Stewardes, amend your wayes; God hath here and there taken all away, otherwhere a great part, moſt have ſuffered: know God is able yet to take away the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: ſeek not therefore in paſſion to break out; what ever you do carry God along with you, and that not in thought but deed; aſſuredly the judgement elſe will be more ſmart, and deeper in every change, lets ſee the Work of God upon your hearts: change Profeſſion into Practiſe of Chriſtianity; idolize not the Form, but acting ſincerely Zeal, Holineſs, Auſterity of Life in the avoiding the very appearances of evil, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary in Charity, and that not onely in giving much, but giving well; ordering the wayes not of your ſelves onely, but of your Families, ſo that the nobility of your ſouls in the excellence of graces may ſpeak you illuſtrious above ancient riches, the Vertues or Vices of your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors. The ſame I may ſay to the Gentry, and men of great eſtate, City and Country; know God gives you much that you may do much for him; wherein is now your excellency? Titles! Alas they are but like <hi>Abſoloms</hi> Pillar, ſerve but to eternize his faults and miſerie. Good cloathes, large Retinue (as Revenew, if not larger) and they generally idle, and ſo neceſſarily vicious; Coaches and horſes, bountiful and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fare, as much ſpent to feed and cloath ten, as well would ſatisfie each day one hundred: and for one hundred, as would plentifully main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a thouſand: Is God honored in all this, or is the poor profited? you may think it; for thus did your fathers, and ſo did you; but where is the Rule? the charges of the Commonwealth, if but five ſhillings, are a burthen to you, who ſpend ten pound, nay a hundred pound, nay a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound in waſte; and they that have nought, follow your example, thereby believing they gain credit.</p>
                  <p>I now ſhall ſpeak one word to the Army; You have followed Providence, make no Selfiſh Intereſt your Idol, leſt Providence forſake you; be aſſured, others have many enemies; but for you, how few are your friends? there are great engagements upon you to God, who hath with ſuch a continued courſe given ſucceſs to your undertakings: I am ſo far from incouraging to Mutinies as I condemn them; there are juſt wayes; uſe them; I would draw all the world by the Clew of evident Reaſon and demonſtrative Juſtice, much more Authorities; and when my reaſon could not prevail, I would at utmoſt lift up my voyce in prayer, with one hand and my heart, and hold my ſword in the other for my defence. All that I ſay, is, be Engliſh men ſtill, war us not into ſlavery whom you were made ſouldiers to redeem from bondage; but eſpecially you Officers, let not promotion cauſe you ſit ſtill becauſe at caſe.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:105181:4"/>
                  <p>I cannot but give out one word of advice to the great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent City of this Nation; you were ſenſible of evils paſt, pride made you fat and you kicked with the heel: Though the greatneſs of Trade be broken, repine not; break not out, there is more loſt in a day then can be gotten in a year; vex not Strangers from your Potency, nor Citizens by your Power: Petition not againſt Will inſtead of Law in others, and uſe far more irregularity, and upon leſs ground your ſelves: you heretofore gained the whole trading of the Nation into your company; we are all Engliſh men, ſhew us your Charter of Priviledge amongſt the immunities of common Subjects: will you admit that a particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in your City ſhould of the Grant of the King have a priviledge to the detriment of your general Charter? why ſhould you then to the dammages of the whole Nation? Agree therefore to juſt things; give God the glory to part with quietly from the convictions of juſt Reaſon, what you might happily hold, either by Law or Power from your Grants, if the Grant be now evil, though not originally ſo; for Reaſon making things lawful, and being the bounds of Supream Monarches in general, it cannot be excluded their particular Grants: I know this will grate hard upon ſome among you; but if Chriſtians, they will hear; it were better to be leſs rich, and leſs populous, ſo more honeſt and better regulated: you are at preſent, yea after ſo long ſitting under the Sword of the Vengeance of the Lord, the ſinke of abominable open prevailing ſins: you that ſhould be the Head to the Body, and the Eye to the Head in the greatneſs of Bleſſings, going before others, and being a Pattern, and Example to all the reſt as a Mother City, as you have been ſtiled in the Nation; you are not active for that glorious Regiment of divine Reaſon, which as Chriſtian, is held forth to us in the Old and New Teſtament of our Lord and Saviour, the Lord Chriſt Jeſus: you labour not in what is eſtabliſhed by Law; then ſure it can be little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that you ſhould endeavor the Settlement of more: it is a work of difficulty; the oppoſition of the world will be; but the world is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and this gives hopes of Conqueſt, when we fight an Enemy that hath been beaten; its the courſe of the world to plead Preſidents, and then the higheſt are the beſt: you are able, do the work; you have done much in ſettling a Magiſtracie in Chief; ſet to the deſign; this is of intereſt publike; but ceaſe not here; fit them to the general end of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as well as to the particular one of Opinion: Its the way of all Corporations; this may not be evil in Politicks; but there is a better in States, much more in Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>And from you I paſs to all Cities and Corporations; You have evils every day which need remedy: you ſpy errors in your Charters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you ſee you are no way able to act for publike benefit: endeavour the Settlement by due conſideration of juſt laws: preſent them, as is due, to the Supream Magiſtrate; let them ſettle the due priviledges, and ſo enable by a ſtanding Law the Rule of your Chriſtian Government in a ſocial frame: Emulation may be hereby a ſpur to excellency of Order, while the improving the ſame priviledges, more or leſs, will evidence the excellency of men, which particular honor is the Bellows
<pb facs="tcp:105181:5"/> to blow up the ſpark of outward Vertue to a flame in a zealous or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>And you rich men, and men of parts in all places, improve your Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, hold forth the Light God imparts to you for the healing of this languiſhing Nation. The poor increaſe ſo vaſtly, through continued and unrepaired loſſes at Sea, and from the deadneſs of trading at Land, that unleſs ſome courſe be taken, all muſt to wrack; beſides the mercileſneſs of Wretches, who ſell the poor for a pair of Shooes; ſome by forging Judgements, and making folks to compound; ſome under colour of Warrants, breaking open of houſes, being Bayliffs, and that at midnight; and then by the Juſtice, its ſaid Juſtices of the Peace, let go with onely reſtoring the goods again, and this ſince acted in ſeveral places, they paſſing unpuniſhed: otherwhere, a Bailiff upon a Judgement of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eight pound, upon a debt of forty pound, out of the Common Pleas, (whereby ten pound ſixteen ſhillings is due to one Officer for one Fee as dammage clear out of their eſtate, who are not worth one far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) comes and makes ſeiſure of a whole Shop of goods, worth by eſtimation above two hundred pounds in Grocery, and other ſmall wares of Silk, Buttons, Lace, Ribbonds, Linnen, and Woollen cloath, &amp;c. beſides all the Houſholdſtuff, not leaving a bed to lie on, or ſtool to ſit on; and theſe are (by whole Sale as they ſay) without any Inventory, or due appriſal, carryed away, and yet no Judgement ſatisfied, that is, not fully; forty ſix pounds is all can be made out of theſe goods; Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly Arreſted onely to force them to compound; for ſtand out a Suit, they are undone, yet who becomes careful to give or crave relief in theſe matters? Thus the poor and miſerable people are daily utterly undone from Forms of Law, and the priviledge is in the Form. O Engliſhmen! deceive not your ſelves and others with ſhadows: Theſe (ſo (more then) evident) errings, wandrings, failings, and unreaſonable, unjuſt proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures of ſo called (and proud of (as ſtriving for the) name of beſt, pureſt, holieſt, &amp;c.) Chriſtians, are the gaps and inlets to all thoſe ſtrange unheard of Opinions, thoſe Blaſphemous and unnatural beſtial actions, and audacious Printings, which there is ſuch a ſtir withal in the world: lay ought to their charge, they recriminate, and beſpatter fouly, and ſoyl hangs: For the letter of the Scripture, if Chriſtians plead that they are gone, it is as killing under the Goſpel as the Law; for the letter of Scripture, and the lives of Chriſtians, are as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent as life and death, hell and heaven: This in contemplative heads, convinced of duty, works high, and aſſuredly brings forth all thoſe Enthuſiaſtick Rapſodies which ſo amaze the world; theſe urge them by degrees to greater heights of ſo called zeal for Gods Truth, and then after a Prophetick ſtrain, they utter things hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
                  <p>I cannot ſee any ground why any ſhould be led away after them, nor give any credit to their ſayings; No, I rather believe it to be the malice of the enemy, ſubtil to deceive; they generally drive at two things, Community, and Parity; the one againſt the Tyranny and Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. of great men in power; the other againſt the covetize, ſelfiſhneſs, luxuriouſneſs, &amp;c. of rich men.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:105181:5"/>
                  <p>Now theſe things, O you great and rich men, do moſt aſſuredly, as you rightly conceive, tend to mutiny, to nouriſh feuds and envyings betwixt the multitude and you. All that I ſay, is, remedy not theſe evils by worſe; you know what Beaſt you have to deal with; its of ſuch ſtomack and force, that Prudence muſt have the honour of the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; if you ſubdue, know its but by a part of the Beaſt (you muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Alluſion) and what in the winding up hath been the iſſue of theſe things, the <hi>Pretorians</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Mamelucks</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers now teſtifie.</p>
                  <p>Conſider therefore what you have to do; God hath ſet all theſe as ſigns and tokens to you; if you fall, the evil is of your ſelves, your improvidencies, lightneſſes, and inſtabilities; your odd and incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain followings of providences, evidence your fears, thoſe your doubts, thoſe the error of your principle; all things work contrary. O that every intereſt now could lay it ſelf down at the foot of Jeſus, and ſay, I part with all for thee, and then take up all it hath as from him, and of his gift, and be ready to part with it to morrow: Should we then live as we do now? How many would then give to the poor to day, leſt they ſhould have nothing to give to morrow? How would they then not delight in luxurious Apparel, Houſholdſtuff, &amp;c. wherein multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of riches lie dead and buried, leſt another ſhould enjoy them to morrow?</p>
                  <p>I know this to ſome melancholy ſpirit may give occaſion to think I aim at, or give too great footing to Community and Parity; for they ſhould in ſuch contemplations caſt away all; but I ſpeak to the ſetled Chriſtian, who knows its lawful to uſe the world, but all in due order; and as its lawful to recreate, but ſpend more time in prayer, then in play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo its lawful to rejoyce in (and to have that we may rejoyce in) outward bleſſings, but glorifie God with a greater portion to the poor then thy ſuperfluity amounts to.</p>
                  <p>I intend a due and juſt reproof to exceſs and prodigality; Keep not all horſes and doggs, ſome poor, not all in cloathing thy ſelf, ſome to the naked, and thy ſelf with moderacy; and yet if thou doſt theſe things, thou meriteſt not Heaven, but thou avoideſt the ſcandal of men.</p>
                  <p>Now that this is not done, is the fault of the Magiſtrate: O Watchman! its thy duty, but thou ſetteſt up for favor and by-reſpect, lazie, idle, and ignorant, and ſome evil Watchmen; therefore the work is not done; and that thou migheſt truſt theſe, thou madeſt thy Law to extend to each matter, or ſo intendeſt: and this was for two reaſons, one that fools, or any might not err, for the Letter was their guide; the other, that they that would abuſe their power, might not; and by this, not having each week a new Law, as occaſion grew, Juſtice and Government is loſt; for act by theſe particular Laws who can, in one hundred thouſand things juſtly requiring remedy? The poor are thus ſold for leſs then a pair of old ſhooes. If you would give a remedy to this, authorize ſome few, or many, who ſhall examine and determine all actions by, or againſt any perſon not worth an hundred pounds; for no Tryal
<pb facs="tcp:105181:6"/> can be under twelve pound, and the eighth part of all a man hath indeed of the thing in controverſie to be ſpent in trial of whether my horſe be mine or thine, my knife, nay the ſheath of that knife, is a woful thing in a Chriſtian Commonwealth: I ſhall not declaim againſt it, but onely ſay, its contrary to the worſt of Heathens proceedings: I intend not to make the wound wider, while I deſire healing; the difficulty ſeems to be onely to perſwade men this is a wound: I have been as lenytive and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in opening this Orifice of the ulcer of the Law and its practiſe as may be: I acknowledge it my Profeſſion, not my Practiſe; and I account this according to the Head Rule of <hi>Englands</hi> Law, rather the Practiſe then the Principle, the error of Cuſtom and intereſt from men, then of the Law; I hold forth nothing for Law which is treated of in the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> but according to the general rule of that Law, holding nothing contrary to the Law of God or juſt reaſon to be its Rule; all which I am ready to all, or any particular, to manifeſt when ever called thereto.</p>
                  <p>And now I come to ſpeak one word to the people; You are of many ſorts, and many intereſts you have; but as I find the worſt and wickedeſt, as educated, profeſſing Chriſtianity, I adviſe you firſt to labour as ſuch, to approve your ſelves: you have, its probable, been moſt of you Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; the Covenant is indelible after once you have (I ſay not been Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, or Baptized with the Spirit) but owned that Covenant, in the name Baptiſm; you are a debtor to the Lord Chriſt of all the duties of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>This then, O poor Chriſtian, goes far; its the Magiſtrates duty to rule well; ſo 'tis thine to obey well: 'Tis the ſame with you as with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Chriſts time, when the great and powerful men ſpeak the Law, and hold forth duties of Righteouſneſs; do as they ſay, however they do; Its the Magiſtrates duty to hear and receive in a right way juſt things from you; and by the implicite Reaſon of power onely to vote them unreaſonable and ſcandalous, is unſatisfactory; but if they do ſo, remain you in your integrity; break not out againſt them, untill the Lord ſhall open a way, he will do it in his due time; go on and ſatisfie thy ſoul in thy own righteouſneſs, I ſay ſo, Comfort thy ſelf in the mercy of thy God, who hath given thee to ſee others failings; and though thy condition be poor and needy, yet break not out: This I ſay of this great ſcarcity which hath faln upon us, wherein I believe many have periſhed, yet the evil hath light on the rude, ſtubborn, diſordered poor, againſt whom mens bowels have been ſhut up; walk therefore according to the condition wherein God hath ſet you; exalt not your ſelves againſt great men, no nor againſt rich men, they will be too mighty for you; poor and proud is a high judgement, it brings miſery with rejoycing. I know many of your ſouls die within you, when you ſee the wicked full, their eyes ſtare with fat; you wait upon God, and your children famiſh: yea many hence think God regardleſs, ſo unjuſt at firſt, at laſt deny him. Fools, know 'tis his Wiſdom, he puniſhes or tries, or both; he puniſhes the body in the want of temporals for brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of duty to thy brother, neglecting the creature, or abuſing it, and
<pb facs="tcp:105181:6"/> the Creator in it: He tries thee for his glory; was he unjuſt in his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with <hi>Job?</hi> then note that poverty is no ſhame, Chriſt hath ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it; no nor death, no not on the Croſs, if as Chriſt the Captain of our ſalvation, thou beeſt made perfect through ſufferings; not ſo, if thou blaſphemeſt, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And now one word to the Teachers of the people; Take heed to your ſelves, leſt while you preach to others, your ſelves become not caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awayes: Some of you call your ſelves ſtill the Clergy, I pray evidence by what ſpecial right or title: next you claim ſpecial Ordination; pray agree to what end; we are jealous of a many among you that would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs all knowledge of the Goſpel by as gainful a Trade as others did and do the Law; Briefly thus, If you have an infallible Word, ſhew it; if but a humane, and that that be attainable meerly or more eſpecially by Learning, and that by diſquiſition knowledge ſhal encreaſe, then ſhew how parts and graces are diſtinguiſhable, and whether you wil quench the ſpirit altogether, or allow it altogether, or what or how; tel me why a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a member of the congregation, by them approved, may not improve his Talent to the edifying of his Brethren, as well as a Batchelor of Art, or Maſter before ordained as you call it, Common Place as you call it, and that often more ſorily then an honeſt Bibling brother that never came at the Colledges, though at the Schools of the Prophets.</p>
                  <p>I cannot diſallow Paſtoral deſignation, and ſo in order from Paſtoral or Teaching abilities; but to reſt in deſignation any more then in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is incongruous; I know this opens a gap to fears of maintenance, but I ſee none juſtly; I pray God your ſtanding off open not wider ones. If you be not the chief, you are none; what is the cauſe of your conteſt? I profeſs, I am not prejudiced againſt any perſon; I have been inquiſitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to intendments, and I judge the tree by the Fruit; may not man do ſo? is it not conſonant to reaſon? When do you leave your Pariſhes generally but to get better, greater Livings? you have made the notions of the Religious a call from one people, and aſſent of the other call but ſtales to your additional maintenance.</p>
                  <p>I agree maintenance neceſſary, but I dare not boggle with the things of God; ſpeak right out, eight ſcore, be it ſo, is but ſufficient by the year to maintain any Family, and till I come at that, I will not hold me to any call; you dare not do it; abuſe not your ſelves, many ſee it; ſay not elſe you can have ſo much in another place. This is the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Harlot; your hot and eager diſputes are the Alarms to our continued feuds (I cannot ſpeak this to all, for there are ſome who imitate as much as this Age will permit, the example of Chriſt their Maſter; and what ever their opinions be in Politicks, they ſubmit to the Powers for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, and what ever they may think, they unrake not the coales of diſſention, much leſs will they blow them to a flame;) here are all our griefs, here is one wound ſo long kept open, hereby is all obedience in all degrees loſt and extinct, no reſpect of Magiſtrate in any degree; the truth is, the unfitneſs of ſome Magiſtrates, in not having abilities, and of others in misimproving them, and ſo of Miniſters, hath heightned by a juſt judgement the evil of contempt on all ſides; the retaining, and ſo
<pb facs="tcp:105181:7"/> eager ſeeking unwarrantable intereſts will make the Callings I fear ſuffer by bringing all into queſtion; my reaſon is, This hath been Gods way here now and before: As all things neceſſary to ſalvation, are (through the goodneſs of God) plain and evident; ſo all things neceſſary to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Government; what Magiſtrates ſtumble at, is the perverſneſs of people in purſuing unjuſt ends to or againſt their fellow-brother, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in cutting ſhort or tying him up too ſtrictly in the requiſites of honour, order, and maintenance, and that for the Publick. The people ſtumble at the Magiſtrates evil uſing, and greatly abuſing his Truſt and power to ſelf-intereſts, profeſſing for the publick, but intending and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bettering ſelf. Its a received Rule, <hi>The diſeaſe is more then half cured, if the true reaſon be known.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O you Magiſtrates and Law-givers, you have the firſt part to act, be you righteous; evil and diſordered people are the manifeſt tokens of a looſe negligent Magiſtracy. Its evidently eaſie to ſettle a Nation more numerous, more diſordered from ignorance and will, then this is; in the time we are diſcourſing how far the Magiſtrates power extends in Religious things, or in a Politick conſideration what ſhall be done when the Nation is ſetled, before the ſettlement be made or agreed upon; let's not to avoid the evils of the worſt of Levelling ſo called, give advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to their deſigns or propoſals: Let's walk, ſo that we may by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as well as power maintain our proceedings; before we undertake, lets reſolve to proſecute or ſurceaſe upon evident and publick reaſon; the want of this hath diſobliged more then ever the Covenant or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement bound. And as I begun with you in Supream Power, Civil, or Military, or both, ſo give me leave to end; when you firſt engaged, when firſt you began this great work of Religion and Publick Liberty, how hot and ſpirituous were you, when great oppoſitions and many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns were on foot? how watchful, when you were running for the Goale and ſtriving for the Maſtery, yea, as your ſelves ſaid, venturing for your own Lives and Liberties? how regardleſs of bare forms? how then could you look at publick good in the nigheſt ſafeſt way? you could then lay out your way beſides the common Road without the formality of ſuing out an <hi>Ad quod damnum;</hi> yea what ſtrength of reaſon could not untye, the Sword did cut: Thus are the burthens, ſnares and vexations of truly religious people gone as to the conſcience: Thus far you have been ſincere in your Obligations to God; be alſo as faithful in your Truſts to the Nation. I would not have Judges taken away, root and branch; Judges are found in Holy Writ, yea ſuch in power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as we deſire to have; we deſire Juſtice ſhould flow like ſtreams, and Righteouſneſs like mighty waters; the want of this impoveriſhes the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I am in ſuch place, that I ſee and know it, yea I beleeve, let it be rightly ſcanned, it will appear moſt coſtly, more ruinous, and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving then two ſuch Armies; and as now practiſed, more intolerable then an univerſal Toleration ſo often charged upon you.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lord God of hearts lay what is written to all your hearts, and grant that you may go on as you have promiſed, namely, according to the great Truſt that is upon you from the people, you proceed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
<pb facs="tcp:105181:7"/> common good, (which is the true and ultimate end of all juſt Government) and by a right aim at that, direct all your actions, and not ceaſe to improve your beſt judgements, and lay out your moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied labours, notwithſtanding all diſcouragements, either from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, envy, danger, or any other cauſe whatſoever, to promote the ſame, ſo far, and ſo faſt, as the ſubject matter will bear; and aſſuredly the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of Heaven will attend and follow you and your Councels; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be aſſured, when God hath made uſe of you for a while, the Lord will caſt you away, as others before you, and your place ſhall no more be found: for the averting of which judgement, and ſetling this Nation and the Government of quiet and peace upon the foundation of Truth and Righteouſneſs, is the prayer of</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lord God for his own glory, and the accompliſhment of his determinate Councels, made the world, and every living thing, whether Angels, or men, in heaven or in earth; which perfected, The Almighty wiſdome, though it could have otherwaies glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it ſelf, thought fit among all the Creatures which his hands had made, to raiſe man to that pitch of honor, as to make him not only the object of his love, but in ſome ſort the Author of his honor, (who is the fountain it ſelf or original ſpring of honor and all other vertues and excellencies) and this he himſelf acknowledges, by ſeveral expreſſions of his own, and Prophets, when men have yielded obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, ſaying they honored him, or gave glory to him. Yea indeed it will be acknowledged of all ſorts of men, that the end of mans Creation was (as is the work of every Artificer) the glory and honor of the Creator, and maker; Therefore the ſame wiſdom that Created man, even while man was yet ſimple and pure, in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute height of his firſt created perfection, put him under the obedience of a Law and Rule in word, to the keeping of which thoſe firſt principles which we call the Laws of ſenſe, and reaſon, were but ſubſervient. But man kept not long that ſtation; but diſobeyed the law of his moſt high Creator, by which error or fall its concluded and agreed, by all Chriſtians, that the whole nature of man was corrupted and tainted, and from being the ſons of God in pure creation, all mankind became the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> by natural propagation; bearing in our bodies the ſting and marks of our firſt ſin, in our daily and continued tranſgreſſions, thruſt out from the preſence of our God, and could dwell no longer in paradiſe. And now the Laws of ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were mans rule, God not holding that lively communion with man, which he did before, to preſcribe him particular and poſitive Commands, or Laws; (at leaſt that we read of.) Yet the goodneſs of our Creator, tranſcendently appeared, in that while he breathes forth threatnings to his diſobedient ſervant, nay actually puniſhes him, in ejecting him the earthly Paradiſe, the Type of the heavenly Reſt, he opens a door of comfort, in ſo ſweet promiſes as he there annexed, of the hopes of a Saviour; under which Covenant he pleaſed in all ages to take a ſpecial regard to ſome men, in and by whom the family and houſhold of God was continued; and to theſe he ſeveral times, and by ſeveral manners revealed himſelf (whether by Dreams, Viſions, Angels, or otherwiſe, is not ſo materiall to be here diſcuſt) and taught them the Laws and Ordinances of his houſe, which Laws we ſee were not ſo contrary to the Law of pure Reaſon or the inherent law of nature, that they wrought diviſion, or ſeparation either amongſt themſelves, or with others, or ſo perſpicuous to the eye of mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that each wanderer ſaw the wiſdom of the Father, and immediately followed that rule and dictate of the divine Spirit; of which families or houſholds it is conceived the Lord had ſeveral in divers Countries at the ſame time; but as being leaſt queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105181:12"/> moſt proper to a Chriſtian, and ſo moſt ſubſervient to our end, we ſhall only look at the direct line of ſcriptural genealogy, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> and ſo to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> of whoſe poſterity in the twelve Patriarcks, was found the people of God, the holy ſeed, among whom were (in his due time) ſhewn the Oracles of God, the depth of wiſdom, both for the government of Gods people as men, or Saints, by the Lords annointed, and every inferior power under the civill Scepter: or by the royall Preiſthood or inferior <hi>Levite</hi> under the Divine declaration. How far <hi>Adams</hi> power extended, or how abſolute it was, I ſhall not controvert, nor yet <hi>Noahs;</hi> but this we may ſee, that it was ſo paternal, that we read not of any cenſure that he gave to <hi>Cain</hi> upon his brothers murther; though we ſee God did; but how it was effected, whether only by the voice of conſcience, or otherwaies, is ſo difficult that we will not gueſs, but conclude, had the knowledge of it been material, either for Gods honor or our good, the holy and wiſe God would not have ſo obſcured it; nor yet gives God a precept againſt murder, but gives it <hi>Noah</hi> after the Flood. That it was want of abſolute power afterwards, that brought ſuch looſneſs, and diſorders upon the world whereby ſin in the ſucceſſions of generations, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> was ſo multiplyed, the contrary ſeems evident, and that from the Tenor of Gods truth: For there were mighty men, who abuſed their power to wrong and injuſtice, therefore were they plagued; we may ſay plainly, they ſought and got power over each other, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the pure law of nature: For (though I am not againſt, nay I am for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as will well appear hereafter, yet) this I ſay, that the law of pure naturals ſets not one above another, which law obſerved, there would be no need of Governors, for each one would be a law unto himſelf: But to return, the power thus obtained, they abuſed it to unjuſt ends, Spoile, Robbery, Rapine, Luſt, and ſuch like; for this came the wrath of God upon theſe children of diſobedience and violence; and the Flood waſhed away them and their ſins together. Yet the Lord remembred <hi>Noah,</hi> for was he juſt, from whoſe poſterity deſcended all the preſent Inhabitants of the earth; and although the fathers were, as <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> righteous in their generations; yet the ſons and progenie of theſe, forgat the laws of their fathers houſe, and fell into the deluſions of <hi>Sathan,</hi> by the luſts of their own hearts; And forgetting the Judgements of God upon the old world, they as well as the ſeed of <hi>Cham,</hi> fell into the ſins of the old world, and promoted themſelves over their brethren, not according to priority of birth, as moſt congruous to reaſon, but by might and power, abuſing thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent qualifications of divine infuſion, againſt the law of the moſt High, and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their factions, they by ſtrength got dominion, which loth to loſe, they combined together againſt God himſelf; nay as ſure as the Lord liveth, the Poet truly expreſſeth the heart of man, Theſe Giants or <hi>Principes</hi> would if they could, have pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God out of heaven; they firſt brake his Laws, and then fought againſt him; but the Almighty now only ſcatters them to his glory; and they who before were bounded in a narrow compaſs, are now diſperſed through all regions, and it is concluded that the chief of them of one language, upon the confuſion of tongues was their Prince, but whether that were the moſt Ancient, Strong, or Wiſe, we ſhall not need here diſpute; it is agreed there was a cheif, and that the moſt ancient, by the general Law of reaſon, owned that place. However it is moſt probable that their dominion extended not over many, or that their power was unlimited: But it ſeemeth among the ſons of <hi>Noah,</hi> that <hi>Chams</hi> poſterity firſt deviated from the rule of nature, in <hi>Nimrod,</hi> who notwithſtanding he had elder brothers, yet took the power of government upon him; yet its conceived he went no further then the government of his own family, the heads of families appearing in the ſame age with him in the offſpring both of <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;</hi> and tis not probable that in thoſe times the government was moſtly ſuch; for they might have enough in one family for one man well to govern, conſidering the many hundreds of years thoſe ancients lived, and the mind of man might well then be contented with it; the profit was care, and the honor duty, and the end only ſafety againſt brutiſh invaſion, which courſe is as moſt natural, ſo moſt conjectural, untill the contrary be proved. And moſt aſſuredly as their families increaſed, even after the diſperſion, ſo divided they the land as well as in the dayes of <hi>Peleg;</hi> and though it may be conceived that in this diſperſion and confuſion of languages, the ſeed or occaſion of future Diſcords, Wars, Jars, and ſuch like was ſown, yet it is probable that the earth in the fulneſs thereof being before them, and the remembrance of kindred being freſh,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105181:12"/> they did not immediately break out into blood, by forcing a diſſeiſing, or putting them out of poſſeſſions who were in; but thoſe unprovided ſought out habitations, and their numbers in their reſpective progreſſes increaſing, they ſent out what we call Colonies: The chief leader or Colonel of which, was, as is moſt likely, the moſt Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, who alſo gave forth to them the general law of their fathers, whether traditional or otherwaies; and the next in degree of age, as the fathers of many children were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as chiefs, next that cheif, or King, and theſe by Scripture according to that phraſe in the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> writing (when now the world was grown to ſome ſetle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in diſordered order) were called Princes; But theſe ſoon wax out the remembrance of their neerneſs of blood (for ſurely where God was not regarded, man was neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) forgetting God and his Law, and private intereſt increaſing, the iſſue was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Wars and Jars. The juſt might ſeparate and divide, as did holy <hi>Abraham,</hi> and juſt <hi>Lot;</hi> but the wicked fought for it, and by power obtained their will, and that law or liberty of blood-letting once admitted, there was no ſtint of ſtrife, they renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Wars as the ſeaſon of the year gave opportunity, and with this ſtrife out of all queſtion came in (againſt the law of nature) the ſervitude of man to man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with alſo a confuſion of families, as to pure diſcent. But let us paſs on and haſt, the Lord makes now his family in the houſhold of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by eſpeciall Covenant of promiſe with him and his ſeed, rejecting all other Nations; Yet how that rejection wrought, is difficult: for <hi>Melchizedech, Abrahams</hi> contemporary was a holy man, and aſſuredly kept purely the law of his fathers, ſuppoſed of <hi>Shem,</hi> though living amongſt the accurſed Cananites; ſo <hi>Pharoah</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to whom the Lord communicated his error in taking <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife, and more eſpecially <hi>Abymelech</hi> King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> who apprehenſive of Gods indignation, for the ſame thing, prayeth as one, and that not only of himſelf, but as of a Nation that knew and kept the Covenant of the Lord, Wilt thou alſo deſtroy a righteous Nation, ſaid he not ſhe is my ſiſter? But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; This <hi>Abraham</hi> is called a mighty Prince, yet Arms but three hundred and eighteen, this confirms what was before aſſerted, ſhewing what Kings and Princes then were, for theſe were to fight four Kings, and manifeſtly proves the generality to be but heads of families (though the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> had now conquered many families) mark alſo <hi>Abrahams</hi> complaint for lack of an heir, urging his power and eſtate to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to <hi>Eleazar</hi> his chief ſervant; Theſe things are inſerted only to lead the weak rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a plain path way of hiſtoricall narration, therefore this one example might ſuffice, but this muſt be more then ſeconded, both in <hi>Iſaac</hi> the child of promiſe, and <hi>Jacob</hi> and his progeny; <hi>Iſaac</hi> was <hi>Abrahams</hi> heir both of goods and graces, yet falls into the offence of <hi>Abraham</hi> his father, and for ſafeguard of his life denieth his wife; And as a King governing his family; hath iſſue <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> Twins, and although the birth right of divine bleſſing is by <hi>Iſaac</hi> given to <hi>Jacob,</hi> yet the temporall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was to <hi>Eſau,</hi> which primogeniture is ſeveral waies; and in the right of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to <hi>Eſau,</hi> by <hi>Jacob,</hi> whoſe ſubſtance was the gift of his God in, and for his faithfull ſervice he performed to <hi>Laban.</hi> But lets haſt to ſee <hi>Jacob</hi> in his full grown family, diſcended into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and there continued the time appointed by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, during whoſe ſervitude, while the yoak of <hi>Pharoah</hi> gauled the necks of his off-ſpring, (the way which God uſed to perform and fulfill his promiſe of freedom, tis ſtrange to fleſh and blood) you can look for no other government upon their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders then the whips of the Taskmaſters, untill the time of deliverance from the Lord comes, who raiſeth up <hi>Moſes</hi> to be their ſaviour and leader; but the judgements of his mouth during the whole courſe of his government, were for the greateſt part extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, even from the mouth, or Spirit of the moſt high God, which although it ſhews how nigh a relation holineſs and obedience can work betwixt man and God, yet ſo far it ſheweth not ought as exemplary to us in our preſent Magiſtracy, either the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior or ſubordinate, in ordinary juriſdiction; neither the Acts or judgements of any of thoſe Judges afterwards, in ſuch ſpecial cauſes of evident ſupream, either direction, or aſſiſtance: neither during their forty years peregrination in the wilderneſs, nor in their daies of reſt, untill they called for a King, nor indeed at any time: That is, we are not to take what ever one judges ſupream or ſubordinate, in ordinary juriſdiction or legall government ſay, as a binding word iſſuing from an infallible ſpirit, or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſuch divine directions; But according to the reſpective laws, and cuſtoms of the place and Nation wherein we live, ordered according to the reaſon, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105181:13"/> of intervening accidents, wherein thoſe general rules, which nature teacheth, of ſelf preſervation, and of preferring generals before particulars, and general and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good before particular, (alwaies preſumed nought be done contrary or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to any part of Divine rule) muſt by all men, as was by them, be obſerved. But ſeeing all that <hi>Moſes</hi> did was not extraordinary, let us a little view his behaviour, in the courſe of this narration, even of that man with whom ſo extraordinary a ſpirit reſted; for his firſt actions I leave the reader wholly to Scripture (only this, he was under perſecution from his infancy, being then expoſed to the mercy of the waters only) for what I ſhall ſpecially aim at, ſhall be, and are his acts judicial, and thoſe either in referenre either to Church or Common-wealth; The firſt law of <hi>Moſes</hi> mouth was not only binding to the <hi>Jew,</hi> but from the equity of it, was, and is, the pure principle of obedience to the ſupream powers, Obey God; for where that is not, or ceaſes, the other is little obſerved; ſo that ſome, which it was thought believed no God, yet profeſſed many, by that ſuperſtition to inforce a reverence, and from thence obedience. <hi>Moſes</hi> now not only gives, but adminiſters law alſo unto the people; in the next place looks to ſetling of civill judicatures, in the ſtabliſhment of Judges, and giving rules for the choice of Judges and adminiſtration of juſtice; wherein it is worth obſervation, that the advice <hi>Moſes</hi> receiveth herein, though not from the mouth of Almighty God, but of <hi>Jethro</hi> his Father in law, yet being agreeable to good reaſon, (I ſay no more) he yields, enquires not of God, nor did God alter it after, becauſe not coming immediatly from himſelf, nor made any declaration by himſelf or <hi>Moſes,</hi> that it came from him, either to get the glory to himſelf, or to enforce with greater authority the acceptation of the ſame: Nor yet diſallows of it after, but approves it, and it was an eſtabliſht Law for the great judicatory of that Nation for ever according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The next thing was the Act of Almighty God in giving the laws whereby the people ſhould be judged, which were ſummarily comprehended and written in two Tables of Stone, (it may be to ſignifie their long or everlaſting duration) which were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Gods own hand (according to our natural expreſſion) unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by him, unto the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Gods people; which Laws were of two ſorts, the firſt concerning God, written in one Table; the other concerning man, written in the other; now theſe being as we ſay general laws, and difficultly could all ſins and offences by the common people be reduced to their proper Commandment, ſo that they would have pleaded ignorance, in excuſe of their ſin; Therefore God gives par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Laws, and Rules, for all emergent ſins, and ſets forth particularly the whole frame and order of the worſhip, and ſervice he expected from his people, yea every circumſtance requirable therein, upon which the whole Law of God, or which God gave to the <hi>Jew,</hi> was or is thus diſtinguiſhed, into morall and ceremoniall, relating from man to God in his worſhip and ſervice of him: And into morall and judicial, relating from man to man; which later muſt be thus opened; The Laws of the two Tables were and ſtill are by many ſuppoſed to be abſolutely morall or perpetual, and that as well to the Chriſtian now, as to the <hi>Jew</hi> then; but the judicial not ſo; but of this more in convenient place and time. Now theſe judicial laws, commonly called <hi>Moſes</hi> judicials, did reſpect both body and goods, all which ſtand upon ſuch order, as is moſt agreeable to natural equity, to the well being of a Common wealth, and that, both in peace and war; To a mans ſelf, and alſo towards his neighbour, ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, and inferior; yea in all things tending thereto; which laws as the <hi>Jew</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them from the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as their cheif and governor; ſo did they live accordingly, giving obedience to them all the daies of <hi>Moſes;</hi> after whom, not <hi>Moſes</hi> ſon or ſons ruled <hi>Iſrael;</hi> neither by his, their, or the peoples ſeeking was any ſuch thing once mentioned, but the government (moſt eſpecial gifts and graces, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his divine vocation, ſhewing forth themſelves in him) was given unto <hi>Joſhua;</hi> but no new law divulged, but the diviſion of inheritances to the ſeveral Tribes in their reſpective conqueſts, was as the Lord had commanded <hi>Moſes,</hi> and he gave forth as a law to the people. And having through Gods goodneſs given poſſeſſions, and in peace, to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> before his death, he calls for all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or their elders, heads, judges, and officers, and from Gods former and preſent mercies, promiſe and threatnings, perſwades them to obedience to theſe laws, which for ſome time they obſerved under their particular heads of Tribes, without any particular Prince, and won great victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries againſt their enemies, (which although I find in hiſtory to be aſcribed to be done
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105181:13"/> under the command of <hi>Phineas</hi> the Preiſt, yet I wave it, and only proſecute the order of Scripture.) The next ſucceſſor in government there given to them is <hi>Othniel,</hi> then <hi>Ehud, Shamgar, Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> then <hi>Gideon;</hi> theſe were by a ſpecial ſpirit of God raiſed up for the deliverance and ſaving <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from the hand of thoſe enemies, into whoſe hand for ſin their God had delivered them; But they ſtill departing from him, that is, from his Laws, not giving either any, or not due obedience, God as it ſeems intending to chaſtiſe them yet more (as the ſtroaks or contentions of friends are moſt bitter) ſuffers <hi>Abimelech</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gideon</hi> by unjuſt and unuſed waies to ſeek not only the government, but a kingdom, yet after his death (whoſe ambition was alſo puniſhed together with the peoples ſin (for the people were Gods avengers on him as he was of the people) now ariſes a new ſucceſſion of Judges of ſeveral Tribes, and as it ſeems alſo by the ſpecial hand of their God upon them, as <hi>Tola, Jari, Jeptha, Sampſon,</hi> after whoſe time there was as it were an <hi>interregnum,</hi> no King, no Judge in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the manifeſtation of the will of God by a ſpecial ſpirit to any chief of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ceaſed, and ſo for defect of worthy noble vertuous ſpirits, the government was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon <hi>Eli</hi> the Preiſt, in whoſe time there was no manifeſt viſion; And though <hi>Samuel</hi> the laſt had it, yet it continued not after him, if it ceaſed not to work at ſometimes in him, who as it ſeems rather out of fatherly indulgence (although he had ſeen the judgements of God upon <hi>Eli</hi> his Maſter, and his family (for ſuch weakneſſes are evident often in Gods deareſt children) then by divine appointment, makes his ſons Judges: but they turning aſide after lucre, and taking bribes, perverted judgement. Whereupon all the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> gathered themſelves together, and came to <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Ramah,</hi> and ſaid unto him; Behold thou art old, and thy ſons walk not in thy waies, (that is righteouſly) now therefore make us a King to judge us like all Nations. Where we may ſee, error in government and governors cauſeth deſires of change of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,  But the Lord commands <hi>Samuel</hi> to liſten to the peoples voyce, but decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to <hi>Samuel,</hi> who it ſeems was alſo a little ſenſible of the peoples neglect towards him, though moſt for God, that this choice of man was their rejection of God. Whence mark, in the purity or pureſt of times, Gods Church was governed as a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in the declining daies it grew to a kingdom. The next thing to be conſidered of, is, to ſee the King ſettled in his Throne, wherein I ſhall firſt ſeek out, how they came to have a King, that is, whether of divine appointment, or of their own election; tis truth that it ſeems both concurred, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 5. compared with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 15. but then the queſtion is moved juſtly, who was the firſt and principal Agent, the Lord in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing, or the people in requiring a King, which being plain on the peoples part, it is objected that the Lord in his firſt laws to his people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 14. &amp;c. gave them a Rule concerning the choice of their King, namely one of their brethren, &amp;c. and that <hi>Jacob</hi> propheſied of the ſame, and that God laid down the duties of the King, &amp;c. To which it is anſwered, that neither the propheſie of <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor Gods laying down the Kings choice, duty, and ſuch like, no nor <hi>Samuels</hi> annointing <hi>Saul,</hi> by Gods appointment, proves any divine inſtitution, no more then the propheſies, &amp;c. of great ſins and defections from God. &amp;c. warrants them: No, no, the utmoſt it holds forth is rather a Divine conceſſion, then an original inſtitution; for the Lord in that eighth of <hi>Samuel,</hi> tells <hi>Samuel,</hi> the people had rejected him for being their King; and laying before the people by <hi>Samuel</hi> the uſage of Kings, ruling at liſt, or according to their own will and power, as it were to deterre the people from it, the peoples ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs <hi>ver.</hi> 7. 8. and 19. and 20. ſhews plainly that in wrath, as the ſpirit elſwhere expreſſes it, he gave them a King, that is, yielded to their deſire of a King; and <hi>Saul,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed by <hi>Samuel,</hi> was choſen by Lot, and being hidden, was ſought, and by Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection found out of the people, and ſaluted King, with a God ſave the King; whence if it be thought fit to be objected, he was choſen by Lot, and ſo the diſpoſition of that being from the Lord, the Lord appointed the King, its agreed; but thence to infer that Kings are of divine inſtitution, it followeth not: This only is properly raiſed thence, that God appointed that perſon <hi>Saul</hi> to be King of his own people: after <hi>Saul David</hi> comes to the Throne, and though by Gods appointment, and ſpecial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> contends with him; <hi>Abſolom</hi> he Rebels, and carries the multitudes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after him; and <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſeſt of the ſons of men ſucceeding, though by <hi>Davids</hi> appointment, yea by divine approbation many waies manifeſted; if not fore-propheſied, he ſo ſins, that the Lord rejects him, dividing the Kingdom, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105181:14"/> now in the ſettlement of hereditary ſucceſſion, that ſpecial ſpirit which accompanied the cheifs or Kings of Gods people ceaſes, as to the moſt, if not all of them, and reſted upon ſpecial Prophets, whom the Lord raiſed up in the Raignes of ſeveral Kings, for the manifeſtation of his glory, and love to his people, not only declaring his notice of their eſpecial ſins, but alſo denouncing judgements in caſe of impenitency, which accordingly fell out in the ſeveral raigns of ſeveral of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> &amp; <hi>Judah,</hi> which ſubſequent Kings were either faithful wholly, or in the main depending upon God, &amp; walking in the waies of <hi>David</hi> their father; or elſe a kinde of formal ſervers of God, not faithfully, but hypocritically, or openly prophane, and Idolatrous, one or two eſpecially, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> who made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin, yet of Gods appointment, renting the kingdom from <hi>Solomons</hi> heire to give it him, and <hi>Ahab</hi> that ſold himſelf to work wickedneſs in the ſight of the Lord, for whoſe outward humiliation only God ſpared the Nation during his daies.</p>
                  <p>Now this is to be noted, that even then, ſuch as was the King, ſuch was the pople generally, and for the greateſt part, at leaſt in outward profeſſion; An idolatrous King, an idolatrous people; a luke-warm King, a careleſs people; a zealous faithful King, a reforming praying people; So far ever was outward ſplendor and power a leader of outward profeſſion, and civil converſation; and under the law, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the Lord was ſerved faithfully, negligently, or prophanely, ſuch was his cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age towards this his people, under faithfull and holy Kings, great bleſſings, both of War and peace; under the indifferent, luke-warm, neuter, ſelf-ſeeking Kings; Secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in peace, and cutting ſhort in War; But under the idolatrous and openly wicked, actual devaſtations, beſiegings, overthrows, and at laſt general captivities; of which, the kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſo called, being of the ten Tribes under the head Tribe <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,</hi> felt ſorely, and ſtill feel, where ever they were carried by the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarch; who was puniſhed as for her own ſins, ſo for the example of her ſiſter <hi>Judah,</hi> whoſe race was yet continued in their own land, under their own governors, but for ſin cut ſhort, and the royal race waſted, or over-awed, the kingdom at laſt became Mercina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſet forth by the <hi>Aſian</hi> Kings, the ſucceſſors of part of the great <hi>Alexanders Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> to a publique ſale, yet ſold to the Preiſts, and of the royal blood, untill at laſt in the fulneſs of time, the <hi>Romane</hi> conquering, or Commanding both the <hi>Aſian</hi> and <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Princes, it was ſold or given to <hi>Herod</hi> an <hi>Edomite,</hi> ſo that now the Law-giver and Scepter departed from <hi>Judah;</hi> The temporal kingdom of the <hi>Jew</hi> in power royal, ceaſed from all the Tribes of <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael;</hi> And now the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves expected the comming of their <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the fulfilling of the Ancient propheſies, according to their received vulgar interpretation, of a moſt glorious mighty powerful Prince then to be raiſed up of God, who ſhould ſubdue all their enemies under them, free them from the <hi>Romane</hi> yoke, now ſo much feared, and ſhould lead them in the ſtrength of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and by his power ſhould conſummate all their joyes, in reducing their diſpertions to an head, and ſeating them freely, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely the Commanders of the Univerſs: Thus private intereſt ſtill led on the people, though pretending to God, ſo powerful is nature ever with the fleſh. Having here drawn into a ſhort ſum the Miſterious hiſtory of Gods dealing with that people, which he did more immediately hold as his own inheritance, and made a ſpecial cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them, before we paſs to new matter, let us a little look back and reveiw, generally and briefly what this people was, the form of the Covenant, the nature of the Laws and Statutes given them by God, and their execution, and ſuch other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars as ſhall offer themſelves. In the firſt age the perſons magnified in holy writ, is, <hi>Abel, Enoch,</hi> and the reſt, what were they but plain men, living innocently; <hi>Abel,</hi> though loving God and loved of God, God reſcues him not from the violence of his brother <hi>Cain,</hi> but he falls and periſhes under his hands; and <hi>Enoch</hi> among the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents lived no more then three hundred ſixty five years, and was tranſlated, (as tis tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated) that is, to Saints, taken into the miſtery of God, but to men ceaſed to live longer on earth; both were bleſſed, yet one dies violently or untimely, the other timely; he lived not half the daies of wicked men before tranſlated; both judgements in mens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts: In the ſucceeding generations after the flood, what was <hi>Noah,</hi> the preacher of righteouſneſs, or of the truth, which were traditionally, or otherwiſe received, as the word of the righteous God? He was neither believed, or regarded of the wicked world, and though he ſaw Gods great judgement upon the world, and his ſpecial mercy to him, in their deſtruction, and his own wonderful preſervation, immediately ſins grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105181:14"/> and is derided of his own accurſed ſon, yet this is the man whom the Lord choſe, and with him enters an expreſs Covenant.</p>
                  <p>When he choſe a Judge and Ruler, whom did he chooſe but <hi>Moſes?</hi> And his preſent qualifications, were, an Alien, expoſed, in a ſtrange land, and fled then for fear of what the eye and Judgement of man called murder, (I ſpeak not this to juſtifie ſuddain murders) and where he was at firſt a hired ſervant, at beſt a ſheppard, a ſtammerer, and tediouſly impertinent, even with God himſelf, and loth to the work, though God had alſo fitted him in a humane way, for government, yea the extraordinary duty which was upon him, to lead a rebellious and ſtiffnecked people, as he found them, to which end ſurely by divine providence (he was not only of a meek ſpirit to bear injuries, but wiſe to make uſe of them) brought up not only in <hi>Pharoahs</hi> houſe, but learned (in more then the ordinary politiques or uſual recreations, of hawking and hunting, ſwearing, drinking, gaming, &amp;c) in all the learning of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> which was the admirableſt of that age, as ſtories witneſs: the very Greeks themſelves, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing their knowledge from them: And this was according to the rule of God; for the choice of a Magiſtrate, men of knowledge, not men that had the age for knowledge, or education, or ſuch like helps, if they wanted the thing, but that knowledge indeed. I omit to ſpeak of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> as exerciſing but only a paternal power, which though it were the foundation or riſe of other governments, yet muſt now be enlarged, as neceſſity evidences, as well as enforces; and when the other Judges, or Heads, or Elders were choſen, they were choſen according to the rule, and ſo long they proſpered; yea go to the Kings, <hi>Saul</hi> ſeeking Aſſes, <hi>David</hi> from the Sheep-fold, and how were theſe deſpiſed (that I may ſpeak it once for all, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of men, ſaw not Gods choice; elſe why did the people ſo murmur againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Miriam</hi> againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> as alſo <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and the next day all the people, notwithſtanding that exemplary puniſhment upon them, ſaying of them ſwallowed up, you have ſlain the people of the Lord: ſo of <hi>Saul,</hi> ſhall he? (he in deriſion, what a Benjamite, a yonger ſon, &amp;c. ſhall he deliver us? how?) Deliver, as if they had ſaid, he cannot; and if you aske me the reaſon both of this and all other diſobediences to propheſies, commands, and declarations of the will of God, I muſt deal plainly with you; the ſame reaſon moved them, moves us; and ſo on the contrary, we believe, or believe not the word; As our harts are affected, ſo move our hands, ſo are our actions enlivened; ſee this when <hi>Saul</hi> chops the Oxen in pieces, and ſends them through all the coaſts of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with that Proclamation, So ſhall it be done to him that will not follow <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Samuel.</hi> The fear of the Lord fell upon them, ſays the Text; what is that, but the Lord put, or raiſed up their ſpirits to the work, and ſo it was effected? and where God gave a ſpirit of ſloath, deadneſs of heart, &amp;c. there they ſet ſtill, and were afterward puniſhed, as well as curſed, who did not help the Lord againſt the mighty: Yea the Prophets were not eſteemed in their daies; which of them came to his end, either without ſufferings, or but by ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings? and who were the Enemies? The Kings, &amp;c. and which of them, but the evill ones, ſee <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah</hi> and the reſt; and yet their great renown was ſpread abroad amongſt ſtrangers, though there may be a reaſon for it, as <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> providing for by <hi>Nebuzaradan,</hi> giving him in charge to <hi>Gedeliah,</hi> and that was he propheſied againſt <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> and for <hi>Nebuchadnezar;</hi> but our Saviour hints another, God did not raiſe up his Prophets in vain, but they were his meſſengers, and againſt the Kings, and Princes, and therefore being hated, or at beſt neglected by them, ſo were they by the inferiors, following their example: and ſo called mad fellows, and by the baſe Prieſts of Idols forbid to propheſie in the Kings Court; and all along ſuch were they whom God choſe, owned, imployed, and Covenanted with; and now not to ſpeak here more of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I come to the nature of the Covenant, which both with <hi>Noah, Abraham</hi> and his offſpring, <hi>Moſes</hi> and all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were in the letter but outward bleſſings; and though by the word everlaſting there is more to be gathered, yet at firſt veiw, what is it? Seed time and Harveſt, the dominion over, and uſe of the Creature, but with reſtraint, not with the blood, cold and heat, Summer and Winter; and now God gives a law, and not before, otherwiſe then as the voice of nature ſounded it forth againſt murder, profeſſing he will not only require the blood of man at the hand of man, and that without any exception, but even of the beaſt; and this law was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſo called partition wall of divine love to the <hi>Jew</hi> was declared, while all men
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105181:15"/> were ſimply conſidered as the ſons of <hi>Adam.</hi> Upon this declaration declaration there is a new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; but what is that? All this land will I give to thee and thy ſeed, and bleſſings where ever they go, aſſured by the note of Gods Alſufficiency, which though typing higher matters, both in reſpect of the place <hi>Canaan,</hi> and his ſeed; the Lord Chriſt Jeſus typed in <hi>Iſaac;</hi> yet <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith fails him; for his life and wife he lies; and <hi>Jacob</hi> pilleth rods, and decieves, as ſome ſay <hi>Laban,</hi> to enrich himſelf, and was irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in his affection to <hi>Rachel,</hi> and other frailties; Such alſo was the Covenant with <hi>Moſes</hi> and all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> In bleſſing I will bleſs, with riches, honor, long-life, victories over enemies; and this was in caſe of obedience to Gods laws; and then for diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Curſing I will curſe, the earth ſhould be Iron, and the heavens braſs; and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, one ſhould chaſe 100. and 100. put 10000. to flight, &amp;c. ſo now they ſhould flye when none purſue; the ſame Covenant with <hi>Solomon;</hi> all which ſhews, that what the Lord held forth to the <hi>Jew,</hi> was outward and legal obedience, ſo called righteouſneſs: and now that the Covenant might have effect, God gives his law, with promiſes and threats; and this according to the nature and quality of it, either toward himſelf, or of one man toward another; for the Laws towards God, they were either the moral, the ſum whereof was the ten Commandments, of which the firſt four are here firſt to be diſcuſſed, and are indeed the prerogative or royall law; which were briefly, To have but one God: Secondly to make no likeneſs of him: Thirdly not uſe his name irreverently: Fourthly to ſanctifie a ſeventh day, if not the ſeventh day to him; all which laws are ſtill binding as accompted morall, though neither wholly accepted nor neglected; the myſtery of the Trinity being by ſome impugned, the likeneſs or ſimilitude of God made now in the ſhape of man, the moſt dangerous Idolatry, his name blaſphemed, and no day kept as it ought, though a day profeſſed for his ſervice: (but of this anon) The other laws were relating from man to man, firſt ſetling the rule of obedience to the then generally ſupream power, being eſpecially paternal; whoſe Complaint the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation were Judges of, as executioners; then he comes to the ſpecial and higheſt crimes, of Murder, Adultery, Theft, to ſecure life, chaſtity, property, and for a further aſſurance gives a law againſt falſe witneſs, and as the ground of all, and root whence theſe vices flow, forbids covetouſneſs. Now theſe laws were given in terror, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, to prove them, that his fear might be upon them, that they ſinned not, (yet all was too little to hold in ſo ſtiffe-necked a people) and after theſe general laws, as the heads of common Juſtice in the root, and branch, he gives other laws for all occaſions, both in reſpect of Magiſtrate and People, Maſter and Servant, Parent and Child, Husband and Wife, Enemy and Friend, or Confederate; and that both for War and Peace, and that with reſpective ſecurity both to day and night, and that for life, Maime, chaſtity, goods, good name; and that as a beaſt might offend, with reſpect to him, as the Oxgoring, yea to beaſt as a ſufferer, as wandring, yea and to the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs and means of healthfulneſs of men, not only in their wandrings, but in their ſettled habitations, remaining ſtill the hoſt or congregation of God, not to have any defilement open to veiw, for all which I refer you to Scripture, with the reſt of the heads ſpecified from the twentieth of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and ſo onward; and having thus ſettled an outward law of peace, and reſt, or War and Captivity, or other Judgements, bound and aſſured by threats and promiſes, the Lord now proceeds to the eſtabliſhment of the manner of his worſhip, which was and is generally holden wholly typical, and ceaſed in our bleſſed and eternal Saviour the Lord Chriſt Jeſus; and this I wholly at preſent omit to enlarge, and now come to the third thing conſiderable, which is the manner of execution of theſe laws, which was very ſevere, as you may ſee in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of <hi>Corahs</hi> ſin, and ſo in <hi>Achans.</hi> The men, wives, children, and all were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, not only by God as in <hi>Corah,</hi> but after by <hi>Joſhua</hi> in <hi>Achan;</hi> a terrible God, a terrible law, and terrible execution; yea the law was extream rigid, if we regard the proneſs of mans nature to offend; what, a poor man to gather a few ſticks for his neceſſity upon the Lords day, and dye for it? what, the Princes and holy men that knew as much by themſelves as by <hi>Aaron,</hi> all devoured by an earthquake, for their zeal in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſacrifice to God? the people were ſo ſenſible of it (but in preſumption) that next day they blame, if not threat <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> for ſlaying the people of the Lord. Now theſe laws were the then rule of the people of God, and by theſe did the people of God under the whole regiment of the law, eithr juſtifie or condemn themſelves: So <hi>Joſeph,</hi> How ſhall I do this, and ſin againſt God? So <hi>David,</hi> thy law is my delight, my
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105181:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> continuall meditation, that I may not tranſgreſs thy will; ſo <hi>Job;</hi> Thy waies have I kept and have not declined from them; and ſo the yong man in the Goſpel, All theſe have I kept from my youth up; and <hi>Paul,</hi> after he was enlightned juſtifying himſelf in his integrity againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> his now perſecutors, ſayes of himſelf, As to law blameleſs, that is, he knew not, nor could any one tell how to accuſe him of the breach of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the law in any title; now if you ask whether theſe laws were the beſt or not, I muſt tell you that moſt undoubtedly the laws in general were ſuch laws as no Nation in the world nor altogether had (from themſelves) ſo exact a plat-form of government; but ſurely ſome of theſe were but particular to that Nation, and that as our Saviour ſaith in the caſe of divorce, yielded unto, rather then given, for the natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the peoples ſake, or by reaſon of the frowardneſs of their diſpoſition, which our Saviour calls the hardneſs of their hearts, ſpecified in divorce, and alſo as that of the law of jealouſie; That law for unclean and clean food, I accompt rather typical then judicial. Now to all theſe laws were Promiſes annexed in caſe of obedience; Threats in caſe of diſobedience, which were often reiterated by thoſe ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, whom the Lord raiſed up, in the ſeveral generations, under the Judges, Kings and Kingly Prieſts, untill the Lord ſent his own Son to declare his will unto his people, in the fulneſs of time; and though <hi>Moſes</hi> were faithful, yet that was but as a ſervant, as ſaith the Author to the Hebrews; but the Lord Chriſt Jeſus, who is the Apoſtle and high Prieſt of our profeſſion, is ſent from the boſome of the Father, to whom the whole will of the Father was known, and in theſe laſt times God ſpeaks to his people by him, even his own Son, whom he made heir of all things, who being the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the glory, and the engraved form of his Fathers perſon, and ſuſtaining all things by his word, hath by himſelf purged our ſins, and ſits at the right hand of his Father; wherefore we ought with all diligence to attend to that heavenly doctrine which this our Lord declares; for if juſt puniſhment were retributed by the Lord to them who diſobeyed the word ſpoken by Angels: how ſhall they eſcape who neglect the Goſpel given by the Lord of Angels, the Son of the Father, to whom the Angels are but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring Spirits? him, of whom all the Prophets fore-propheſied, even the <hi>Shilo,</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Saviour, who ſhould ſave his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and lead them through the wilderneſs like a flock of Sheep, under whom they ſhould lye down in the pleaſant places of reſt, and none ſhould make them affraid; He that was now expected by the <hi>Jew;</hi> and ſo much the rather, as fearing bondage from the imperious and flouriſhing <hi>Romans,</hi> and hoping of ſalvation and deliverance, temporal Grandeur, power, and dominion, by his puiſſance, who was to break all Nations as a Potters veſſel, and threſh them with an Iron Mace; to whom all people muſt bow down, the mighty Councellor, the Prince of peace, and his yoak muſt be upon their neck, and his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon their ſhoulders, till time ſhould be no more.</p>
                  <p>Now lets a little conſider how the ſtate of <hi>Iſrael</hi> or the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> ſtood at the time of Chriſts coming; That they expected the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is evident, they ſeeing thoſe things fulfilled which were fore-propheſied, of which ſure they were diligent heeders, eſpecially being driven thereto by ſo many daily fears, as the power of the <hi>Roman,</hi> and the Tyrany of their ſtrange King put upon them; and the Scripture notes of divers to whom God had imparted a true underſtanding of the light of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy, who kept continually in the Temple, and ſerved God day and night with faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prayers, looking for, or expecting his coming; and no doubt they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples abroad, who being inſtructed by them, had their hearts prepared to believe him, though no outward form, beauty, or comlineſs (as others thought) appeared in him; So that their expectation was general; but each one after the rate of light and knowledge, true or falſe, which was impared to him, or he had received under his Rabby, who read the Law to him, who were of ſeveral opinions, (not altogether dead yet) as <hi>Phariſes, Sadduces, Eſſenes,</hi> and theſe again ſubdivided according to the merit or acceptation of the Rabbies or Doctors of the Law.</p>
                  <p>The Temple was in reſpect of the legal ſtrictneſs polluted, the whole law by theſe interpretations, inſtead of Gods rule, become mans Fancy, or at beſt his precept; for all was now grown into the vaſt Ocean of ſubtilty of conceit, and that Rabby was moſt venerable who could flye the higheſt pitch in ſublime conceits, ſo that the pure Law was made a puddled fountain, and the ſpiritual heavenly meaning was loſt in carnal voluptuouſneſs and ſelf-endedneſs; there was great learning, never more,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105181:16"/> but never to leſs purpoſe, much praying and faſting, Aſhes and Sack-cloth, yea and beſmearing their faces, to ſuborn humility, but all to hypocriſie; and yet ſure if in <hi>Eſays</hi> time they Juſtified themſelves againſt God as impotent, that he could not ſee their faſting nor humiliation, and ſoul affliction, nor hear their prayers, nor anſwer them by deliverance, as in the fifty eighth of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> then much more now, when grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mercies were expected, and longer time had revealed more light; but they did all for pretence; this, and almes, and all, to be ſeen of men; to devour widdows houſes, and enrich themſelves; though the whole State were beggered, eager and ſtrongly contending for priviledges, but ſtill to better themſelves, though greater loſſes to the publike accrued; condemning their fathers, and ſurely the ten Tribes their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who were before carried captives by the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and placed beyond the great River; and juſtifying themſelves as holy, in that they built the Sepulchers of thoſe Prophets whom their fathers had ſlain; And by this expecting the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and by him deliverance, and this was the ſtate of the <hi>Jew</hi> at the birth of our bleſſed Saviour, born of <hi>Mary,</hi> at <hi>Bethlem,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> of the ſtock of <hi>David,</hi> yet as not own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inheritance in the world, brought forth in an Inn, his Cradle a Cribb, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts the Ox and the Aſs, the room being no better then the ſtable; yet where God ſtirred up the hearts, there was he worſhipped by Kings, if not by wiſe or learned men, of great eſteem; ſought to be ſlain, flyes into a ſtrange land, and then is brought by his father to a mean village, where he ſubmitted himſelf to all the laws which his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Moſes</hi> had delivered, not only in the circumciſion of his fleſh, but in fulfilling the whole law, and that not only private and domeſtick in his obedience to his reputed father, and his mother <hi>Mary;</hi> So that he was called not only the ſon of the Carpenter, but the Carpenter (untill ſuch time as he was called out to his Fathers work, which was firſt at twelve years of age, to the aſtoniſhment, as confuſion of the Doctors, which was Gods Act of preparation to thoſe Rabbies, had they not had eyes that they might not ſee, and ears that they might not hear, becauſe the Lord would condemn them) but alſo in the publique adminiſtration of the Jewiſh law, appearing by his going up there to the Paſſover, and that not only to his God (as man) but to his Prince, yea though a heathen, a ſtranger, giving his tribute to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> he had alſo a fore-runner, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, in whom I muſt obſerve, that he preached a new doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm, yet even the rulers went out to him, and though he in his preachings ſhewed the error of the then ſort of teachers, he was not meddled withall, nor oppoſed, much leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned; But now when Chriſts time was come to preach, I pray let us mark his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, firſt he goes to <hi>John,</hi> and is of him baptiſed, and then recieving a teſtimony from heaven, to prepare the people to recieve his doctrine, he then is carried into the wilderneſs to be prepared himſelf by temptation, whereto his manhood in it ſelf was ſubject, but by the Godhead ſuſtained, and this finiſhed whereby he was approved, he now ſets upon his work for which he came, and as a Doctor of the law he preaches, or declares the minde of his Father; <hi>John</hi> he begins in (a ſtrange place) the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and he cries, Prepare the waies of the Lord, make his paths ſtraight; the Lord Jeſus he follows, and in the land of <hi>Zabulon</hi> in the City <hi>Capernaum</hi> (the obdurate people had need of redouble blows) he preaches, and ſayes, Amend your lives, for the kingdom of God is at hand; and then he chooſes or calls to help him in this great work of reforming ſinners (and that of the greateſt ſort) poor fiſhermen, ſurely as rude and ignorant as the reſt, in ordinary, and theſe he makes his partners in the work, and now inſtead of expounding <hi>Moſes</hi> law, according to the order of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſes</hi> in the Synagogues of the <hi>Jews</hi> (places of publike meetings for that end, but alwaies intended for the ſervice of the moſt high and true God by the <hi>Jew</hi>) he preaches the Goſpel of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and withall healed their bodies, no doubt to intimate that what he preached of the blindneſs of their mindes, was not only true, but that he would and could heal theſe alſo, he being for that end come into the world; and now his fame of miracles and ſalvation to the body being ſpread abroad, he hath great renown and glory; for ſuch benefits are quickly reſented, and now this prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made (miſtake me not that I think Chriſt or his doctrine had need of any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward help, in reſpect of his power, who could of ſtones raiſe up children unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> but in regard of his will, it being ſo by the Almighty wiſdom pre-decreed that all things in ordinary courſe ſhould be ſo carried, that no man ſhould without his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſee, that good or evill was to man, but by means, though the wiſe man ſaw the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105181:16"/> contrary) he divulges his Goſpel full of inward rayes of divine wiſdome and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, but averſe to the then recieved doctrine, the intereſt of the then prevalent (party) or factions, the <hi>Phariſes</hi> and <hi>Sadduces;</hi> who had the trick of this age to count all gain ſweet, and were (not by words to aggrandize that ſin which was high enough in it ſelf) no better then hypocrites, even the beſt and ſtricteſt of them; for ſo our ſaviour bears record, If your righteouſneſs exceeds not that of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes,</hi> you can in no wiſe enter into the kingdom of God; and if I be not decieved, his whole doctrine tends to this, namely to prove, ſalvation was not through the righteouſneſs of works, but by faith in him, and yer evidences this faith by the works of the law, but not according to the vulgar interpretation of the doctors of the law, but according to a more divine and exact rule, which I ſhall thus diverſify; the Doctors gave a liberty from or beyond the letter, for their lucre and mans luſt; Chriſts rule is reſtraining the liberty of the letter, if any liberty were, againſt all lucre, ſelfe end, or advantage what ever, as is moſt evident in the expoſition of our ſaviour upon the ſixth and ſeventh Commandments, manifeſting it was not only the act of Adultery, but an unclean thought that God abhorred; and it was not only the life of thy brother which God forbad thee to ſeek after, but even of thine Enemy; and as a private perſon, you were not only not to puniſh the offender, againſt thine own ſelf and life, but to do good againſt his evill; and for thy brother, take him in natural, national, or ſpiritual relation, (all which I preſume ought to be there intended) thou oughteſt not by evill words, either to provoke or revile him; this was the Doctrine of him who was the Prince of peace, and gave laws all of love; it was his legacy, his will, his precept or Command; ſo that I ſee not by this doctrine in any thing the law moral nullified, but explained; and this I take to be out of doubt (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to the fourth Commandment) on all hands, which yet he takes not away, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he doth give a liberty which the Rabbies granted not, (at leaſt in him) namely to do good that day; and ſurely though he makes man lord of the ſabboth, it was not to take away Gods omnipotency in the power he had over man, and all his daies; for the reaſons of the ſabboth, or a holy reſt, are ſtill the ſame, both in reſpect of man in his freedome from labour, and thereby made more fit for ſpiritual ſervices, and alſo in regard of the ends, mans increaſe of outward knowledge in the written law, or revealed will of God, and the glory of the Creator (if he can reap any from the weak imperfect duty and endeavour of the Creature.) But the Lord himſelf I ſay did in no kind abrogate the day, which God inſtituted in paradiſe, though he cleared the <hi>Jews</hi> miſtake in their manner of obſerving that day. In the next place for the judicial law, our bleſſed Saviour he meddles not with it, any way to annull or diſapprove it; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his diſciples obſerved it, and he ſaies of that, and all the whole law, he came not to deſtroy the law but to fulfill it; and was ſo far obedient, as that he would not meddle as a Judge, whom God had made but a miniſter, and celebrates the paſſover accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome; till he came to preach he wrought the work of his earthly father; after that he profeſſed the labourer was worthy of his hire; and doing his heavenly fathers work, going about and doing good, healing all diſeaſes both bodily and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and that to all perſons without reſpect of Nation or quality, ſinner as Saint, Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as ruler of the Synagogue, the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi> as well as of <hi>Jairus</hi> daughter, or <hi>Mary,</hi> or any, and giving the ſame rule to his Apoſtles, he ſends them abroad without either Scrip or Staffe or money in purſe, yet aſſures them that as himſelf was rejected of his own, when he came to them, and they knew him not; ſo muſt they, his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, expect the world would uſe them; they muſt be brought before rulers, Kings &amp; Emperors for his name ſake, (Majeſty is alwaies jealous of Competition.) See who ſhould be his Enemies; But not only ſo, they ſhould be hated of all men for his truth ſake, that is the reaſon why hated, for his truth or names ſake; and that they might not be diſcouraged, he foretels his paſſion; but how wrought it at the time of Trial? all fled but <hi>Peter,</hi> and he denyes him; which of the rulers, ſay the Rabbies, ſeeſt thou believe on him? for <hi>Nicodemus</hi> the ruler came only by night, none knew it; mark it, the wiſe men reſt in their wiſdome, and the rich though convinced, yet are wary; ſhame, or fear, or both (of men) keep many a man from God; yet they knew him; his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles they attribute to the Devils power, he evinces the contrary, they yet believe not; they admire, but believe not; thus he ſpends his time, and having attained ſeventy Diſciples, and ſome few women, and here and there a Sinner, with whom
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105181:17"/> he moſt converſed; for he came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance, through the meekneſs of his carriage, and goodneſs to all, having taken off the eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the multitude, and made them followers of him, if but for his wonders ſake; he is in the appointed time betrayed to them (who now were jealous leaſt the multitude ſhould believe in him, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> come and take away their Nation) by his own Diſciple, when he had now declared and ſanctiated his Teſtament, at which whether <hi>Judas</hi> was preſent I will not ſtand here to controvert, but only ſay if he were, it is for terror, not comfort or warrant for ſinners to approach theſe ſacred myſteries without due examination; he eate and drank his own damnation; but being hidden, I ſhall not ſearch further, or difficult I will not here determine further; and being now apprehended, its conſulted whether he ſhould be put to death; the High Prieſt (prophetically ſaith the Scripture) politiquely ſaith the rationaliſt, leaſt the people making him King, as was like they might, induced by his powerful workings, and thereby hoping in and through him to be delivered from the Romane yoke, which the great men feared would bring an aſſured and ſpeedy bondage upon them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, better one die then all; and then by that people (oh vanity) who before they feared would make him a King, they now condemn him as an enemy to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> but that not holding, by their choice of a Murderer, the Heathen judge acquitting him, they condemn him; and now his Apoſtles and Diſciples preach the ſame Doctrine after his reſurrection, by which they were eſtabliſhed, being before ſhaken grievouſly; we thought this had been he, ſaieth one, and all were affrighted at his firſt ſight, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Scriptures, yet ſaieth he, they plainly teſtified of me (and I pray take notice, to <hi>Sathan</hi> in his Temptations, to the Lawyers and Phariſes and other the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the old Tempter, and alſo to his Apoſtles, he uſeth the word or letter of Scriptures, which was in ſelf convincing, but to the Firſt the word only, to the Second oft, not only the word, but a further and more ſpiritual meaning) and I pray ſee the ſame foundation Chriſt was, and laid, The ſame the Diſciples, Apoſtles, and others uſe and build with and upon, and in the ſame way, according as they received light (which was not all at once (I pray obſerve that) they had the ſpirit all, but all nor any of them had all the Spirit; they had their portion, the grace as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, which was given ſome in one kinde, ſome in another; therefore they firſt apply themſelves to the <hi>Jew;</hi> our ſaviours rule while he lived, was, Into the Cities of the Gentiles enter you not, but go you firſt to the loſt-ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but after a time God manifeſts by the viſion of <hi>Peter</hi> (ſo God taught him firſt) after by pouring the holy Ghoſt upon the faithful houſe of a Gentile that they might be baptized; and now after a diſputation and ſatisfaction from <hi>Peter</hi> of theſe things (they that were infallible in particulars which the ſpirit gave them, were not knowing and ſometime erred in what God yet revealed but to <hi>Peter</hi> (I pray note this but now) freely they preach to the Gentiles, and zealous <hi>Paul</hi> of a perſecutor (I ſay no more) made a preacher, he goes eſpecially to the Gentiles, and with much labor and travile, and with many dangers preachers Chriſt; but the Divel is as buſy as may be; he feared not theſe men who had received the holy Ghoſt, and had abundance of the ſpirit, he throws his ſtone, and hath Agents enough to roll it; now the Gentiles are admitted without diſpute; the queſtion is if they be not bound to <hi>Moſes</hi> law. I finde no queſtion of the moral; the ſcruples are concerning the judicial and ceremonial; the firſt queſtion was concerning ſome that taught the brethren circumciſion was needful to ſalvation; this controverſie which hath filled the world ſo called Chriſtian ſo full of controverſie from that time to this preſent day, as namely whether we be ſaved only through the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt apprehended by faith, or have need alſo as to ſalvation to obſerve the Law, that by the <hi>Jew</hi> was meant of the viſible law ceremonial, by the Chriſtian moral &amp;c. The wits of the world ſaw not then the evidence of the ſpirit, nor would acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in the reſolutions of the very Apoſtles themſelves; ſo that the congregation at <hi>Antioch</hi> being hereby in great diſturbance were enforced to ſend <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to congregate the reſt of the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> this upon a full meeting, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its end and determination; where being recieved of the church, Apoſtles, Elders, and brethren, who were called together, and the matter publiquely debated before them, the reſult of which <hi>Peter</hi> declares to the Church or multitude of believers, evidencing by the letter of ſcripture, and that of the old Teſtament, which ſurely is one of Gods witneſſes, That, the Lord in calling the Gentiles, who were uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105181:17"/> which before was the viſible condition of ſalvation, declared and teſtified, That ſalvation was in Faith without any Oblation to the Law. But miſtake not; I intend not here, as if the Queſtion were of abrogating <hi>Moſes</hi> Judiciall, but that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was not tied to the obedience to that, or the whole Law; but only through the grace of the Lord Jeſus: which being allowed by <hi>James,</hi> he gives his ſentence, that the believers of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> be not yet till further inſtruction, tied up too cloſe to the ſeverity (as their vain liberty will account it) of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> rigor, but in thoſe things which will caſt too great an <hi>odium</hi> upon us with the <hi>Jew,</hi> as participating in Idoll Sacrifices, whoredome, the great and ordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of the <hi>Gentile,</hi> and in eating any thing ſtrangled, or bloud, as being a precept highly eſteemed with them, lets in theſe, write to them that they abſtain; to which all agreeing, it ſeemed good to the Apoſtles and Elders with the whole Church, to ſend this their reſolution in letters by certain of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> together with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas:</hi> the ſtile, phraſe, and order of which holding ſorth ſtill the pattern of Chriſt their Maſter and Teacher's meekneſs, gentleneſs, and lowneſs, the Lamb dumb before the ſhearer, and teſtifying their unity in Chriſt their head, take notice of in the parts; the Inſcription whereof was, The Apoſtles, Elders and Brethren, unto the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren (not the Elders, nor Officers, but Brethren) which are of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, Syria, Cilicia,</hi> ſend greeting, in the body; Foraſmuch as we have heard that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (or <hi>Jews</hi>) have troubled and cumbred your minds, ſaying you muſt be circumciſed and keep the Law; to whom we gave no ſuch command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to teſtifie which, we ſend eminent men in the faith to you; for it ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt and to us to lay no more burthen upon you then theſe neceſſary things, that (to the end no offence be given to the <hi>Jew;</hi>) you abſtain from things offered to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, bloud, things ſtrangled, and from fornication, from which if you keep your ſelves, you ſhall do well; fare you wel. Here was no charging, willing, and commanding from the ſacred Synod; no Authorrity of the Church urged, more then the note of intimation, that what was done, was by them who had received the holy Ghoſt: The iſſue is alſo conſiderable; for theſe Commiſſioners of the Churches, both of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> comming now to <hi>Antioch,</hi> I pray conſider their carriage, they aſſemble; whom? the Elders or Preachers? no, they would not tie the people to believe implicitely; therefore they aſſemble the multitude, all the believers, and there they deliver the Epiſtle, which is read with joy for the conſolation.</p>
                  <p>This done, Satan is at work again, raiſing ſtrife and contention betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> ſo that they parted company: wherein I pray note, the children of God, nay, the choſen veſſels, yea, conſecrated by the actual operation of the Spirit, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject more or leſs to humane frailties; conſider further, <hi>Paul</hi> after this deciſion of that great controverſie at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet by and by he circumciſes <hi>Timothy,</hi> to give content to the blindneſs of the <hi>Jew,</hi> and was never called to account for it either at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or <hi>Antiochia;</hi> and though himſelf at the ſame time delivered the deciſion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Elders at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to thoſe converted to the faith of Chriſt in the Cities about as they travelled, to eſtabliſh their minds, in caſe either the controverſie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Laws neceſſity were there raiſed already, or might right riſe afterwards; by this humane Wiſdom, labouring to prevent a further increaſe of that controverſie. And if it be queried why they did not miraculouſly do it, as well as heal diſeaſes, and ſuch like; Know O man, that it was contrary to Gods Ordinance; he appointed preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to convert the world, and miracles were Trumpets to call the people together, and prepared them to receive the Word, and with the Word God gave grace as he pleaſed; and that this muſt be ſo, is plain; for all that ſaw the miracles, attended not to the Word, and all that did both, were not converted: Thus you ſee the devils beginning; he preſently raiſes up controverſies in the Church, and alſo perſecution; without the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles are impriſoned but for magnifying Chriſt; one condemned to death as a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, an enemy to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> See, it was the doctrine of Righteouſneſs was oppoſed, but Treaſon is charged; how many Chriſtians have played faſt and looſe for this cauſe with Chriſt? for, could they have ſuffered as Martyrs, and had the point of Controverſie been the main of their charge, they would have ſtood it out to the laſt; but that being but by the by, and Treaſon or Diſobedience to Powers the chief, they faltered; but the Apoſtles and Diſciples, through good report and evil report, went on in the Work, and great wonders were every day done, confirming the believer, and aſtoniſhing the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105181:18"/> oppoſer; ſo that now in the greateſt Cities of <hi>Aſia; Greece,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> the Goſpel is preached, wherein the believers of all ſorts have the ſame rules laid down, which Chriſt delivered to his Apoſtles, clearing ſtill the righteouſneſs of the Law, but not placing Salvation in obedience to it, as is manifeſt in all the writings of the Apoſtles; and by them, as by our Saviour, urged by the Letter of the old Teſtament, declared by the Prophets againſt unnatural luſt, idolatry, coveteouſneſs, maliciouſneſs, envy, murder, debate, deceit, frowardneſs, extortion, pride, boaſting, idleneſs, haters of any good, doers of any wrong, inventors of any evil, diſobedience to any power, ignorance, breakers of Covenant, without naturall affection, unappeaſeable, mercileſs; and that theſe are worthy of death, he appeals to the Laws, which if he meant of nature to the unconverted <hi>Gentile,</hi> whoſe morall ſtrictneſs was moſt admirable; then ſurely to the converted he much more intended the Law of God given by <hi>Moſes</hi> unto his people, according to an everlaſting Covenant, being of generall neceſſity and convenience under the Goſpel as during the Law; and by thoſe Laws he ſaith, the offender deſerved death; and ſurely that particular cruelty, was univerſal mercy; and in and through all the writings of Scripture there is urged, not onely a neceſſity of having, (but of obedience to) the Law, but for civil benefit, not as ſaving, but as found general in thoſe whom God had elected, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues ſtrongly, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> to be univerſal to all believers; ſo that it was a Covenant of Faith; and if I be not miſtaken it is plain, the Covenant is, though called double, yet not liable to that diſtinction of Works and Faith, but that which was through the veil which was then upon the profeſſion of the Law, placed in the obedience onely to the Law, and ſo called of Works, was now unveiled, and declared to be onely by Faith; but withall evidenced that, that faith which was not ſtill working, was dead, and the teſtimony of our faith to the Church was our works; and I ſee not but that the outward promiſes, or promiſes of outward bleſſings are ſtill the rewards of legal obedience; and for the reward of faith, I ſee no promiſes but of eternal bliſs; and though the faithful keep the Law, yet they reſt not now upon the promiſes of the Law; but the glad tidings of the Goſpel ſound in their ears, and they are fixed upon the <hi>Allelujahs</hi> of eternity: Out of all which we may gather, That the Law not only Moral but Judicial, being not abſolutely and neceſſarliy proper to the <hi>Jew</hi> onely, as being either Ccermonial, or alluding ſome way thereto, was the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of common or civil, and alſo of Chriſtian equity to the whole Church believing in Chriſt, whether <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> which is plainly manifeſted through both the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but now all the Ceremonial Law being Typical of Chriſt, that was aboliſhed, ſo that as the ſhadow vaniſhes when the ſubſtance appeareth, the proper Prieſtly fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſervice, ſacrifice, rites and all are buried; and will God now leave no Rule of Faith, no worſhip, no day, no order, no government, no maintenance? Let us ſee the way for this: Firſt, Chriſt taught, then his Diſciples, then each Chriſtian inſtructed one the other; and upon this ariſeth Sects and Diviſions, even in the Apoſtles times, ſome were of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſome of <hi>Apollos,</hi> ſome of <hi>Cephas;</hi> ſo that now what was the Church, of or in a Province, was, or might be divided into ſeveral Congregations; and that either differing in a Circumſtance, yet holding all the head in one Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of worſhip upon occaſion, and ſo onely a Sect, or differing in opinion in things not plain but doubtful, or elſe in matters which were counted of ſuch value, or ſo nighly concerning the principal points of faith, that they did, as it were, rent from the Head, and would not admit admixtion, which were the producers of Schiſm; and this was, or ought to be as was at firſt ſuppoſed, onely in hereſie, things or opinions inconſiſtent with the rules of Chriſtianity, which either did appear, or it was declared would appear in <hi>Pauls</hi> time: Now how doth <hi>Paul</hi> deal with theſe. Truly what power he had concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that he either uſed not, or pretended not unto, is not poſsible to judge of; but what he uſed was according to the nature of the Covenant explained, which was of faith, for the works of the Law, in literal obedience; man may enforce obedience, but Grace is the onely gift of God; and therefore he onely uſeth the ſword of the Spirit, which was the Word, powerful indeed in a right and skilful hand, and no other; he informs, and labors to enlighten them, that Chriſt was the head; and if a member were divided from the Head it was no longer a member; and tells them plainly, that Chriſt was the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and who ever laid other, however wiſe in the ſight of the world, whether of worſhipping of Angels, mediation by Saints, abſtaining from meats, forbidding to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105181:18"/> marry, obſerving of daies, and all ſuch like, though they had a ſhew of wiſdome, in voluntary humility, and beating down the fleſh, yet they were will worſhip, the gate for <hi>Sathan</hi> to enter by, and by carnal ſeeming wiſdom, to build with hay and ſtubble, and daube with untempered morter, yea to change the truth of God into a lye through the decieveableneſs of the fleſh; for theſe precepts of men, being admitted, firſt as explaining the will of God, were then accompted helps, then neceſſary, then matter of faith; and this propheſie, who is ſo blind that hath not ſeen fullfilled? therefore he adviſes, to beware of vain humane wiſdome, or philoſophy, which was bewitching, and tells that this myſtery of iniquity began to work, and would work, and that there would ſpring Hereſies, yea that it was neceſſary, but from the Goſpel no one muſt depart, no not though preached by an Angel from heaven; and leaſt the people of God ſhould be diſcomforted by the afflictions and perſecutions of the Apoſtles, and other diſciples and profeſſors, it is often plainly declared, they muſt look to tread the trace which their bleſſed Saviour had done, who was the high Prieſt of our ſalvation, who was perfected through ſuffering; but withal declares, and it is plainly laid down, a moſt triumphant time ſhould follow, whether here, may be doubtful to many, but hereafter is believed by all. So that that weight of glory ſhall far out-ballance the ſufferings which any one under went for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſake. And truly the perſecution even after the death of Chriſt was immediately great by the <hi>Jew,</hi> and though God left himſelf not without witneſs, even among the wiſeſt of them, as in <hi>Gamaliel, Nicodemus, Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea, Paul</hi> moſt notable, and others: yet there was little ceſſation, through the great diviſion and factions, which God ſuffered them after the death of Chriſt to fall into, (<hi>Hieruſalem</hi> being a type of ſpiritual <hi>Sodom</hi>) gave warning to the believers in Chriſt, to flye out of that <hi>Babylon,</hi> that ſo it might be prepared for that firſt coming of Chriſt to Judgement, which he did by the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Eagles flying and hovering over that carcaſs untill the appointed time, when by them it was devoured; and now begins the curſe upon the remainder of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of the ten Tribes, <hi>Judah</hi> and the reſidue, for their ſins, being not forewarned by the great judgement, which fell upon <hi>Samaria</hi> and her children, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by that moſt fearfull imprecation, His blood be upon us and upon our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which City thus taken out of the way, the perſecution ceaſed not, but is renewed more bitterly, under the heathen Emperors and their ſubſtitutes, in the ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Empire, and let us mark the Divels cunning, all evils were laid to the charge of the Chriſtians, not only ſedition, and tumults againſt the State, but the cauſers of thoſe direfull evils, of War, Famine, Plague, Inundations which over ſpread the face of the earth; but theſe could not be ſo well proved; Though undoubtedly, the interpreters of the heathens Oracles gave good ſatisfaction to them were willing to believe it, but they had more evident Teſtimonies, if publike fame had not been ever ſubject to lying, they were breakers of all the laws of nature and nations; and this had ſome foundation in ſence and reaſon; for they that taught that the love of the Gods was not obtained for, nor yielded to good life, right dealing, earneſt ſerving of them, nay though accompanied with never ſo much inward zeal, or outward fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor; The Philoſophers could eaſily ſumm the poſitions of the Chriſtians into this General Doctrine, and then let them alone, to conclude, that ſurely there could be no expectation that theſe men ſhould do any thing according to the law, but for luſt, or pleaſure, or profits ſake, and therefore counted them enemies to all civill, moral laws, and living, and what could they then lay to their charge, which would not eaſily be believed of them, not only Adultery, but inceſt; not anger, but murder; not ſwearing or lying, but perjuries; and all abominations; and though theſe things were not done by day, their outward lives were civill and juſt, it was in the night, and though common Juſtice appeared in them to their neighbours, it was Hypocritical, their vitiouſneſs was acted amongſt themſelves, or ſuch ſeeds ſown, as would infect a future generation; And no doubt <hi>Paul</hi> having blamed them for going to law with one another, but eſpecially before heathen Judges, which opinion they could not but hold in ſome part, while their Saviour taught them ſo oft to forgive their brother, and to him who would take thy cloak, to give thy coat alſo; theſe circumſtances were aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, as people looking at no Government, no order, no diſcipline; <hi>Pauls</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, exhorting, convincing, perſwading, holding no communion, delivering to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> were to them fancies of the ſpeculative underſtanding, and all his weapons, not

yet even then, how many that left houſes, and lands, and all in affliction for Chriſts ſake in the ſtorm, would never return from the Churches habitation in the wilderneſs in the ſun ſhine; but waſted themſelves in continual prayers, faſtings, meditations, holy vows, and all exerciſes of the height of zeal; counting all too litle they could do for Chriſt? how many flouriſhing virgins, thus eſpouſed themſelves in the Wilderneſs to Chriſt, as well as to the fire, to the beaſts, to variety of deaths, and tortures for him in the Cities, and Towns? how lowly, plain, and painful were the then Paſtors of Congregations? <hi>Paul</hi> taught, the labourer was worthy of his hire; but lookt at a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward far above earthly treaſure, they were the firſt in holineſs, every one choſen who had moſt ability; the ſet ſtipends were not their provokers, but zeal for Gods glory; what was given was not received, then ſure what was witholden, was not ſued for; And now it was plain, perſecution was not the way to eradicate Chriſtianity; and the very heathen Emperor <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, whoſe heart knew horror for it, as Chriſts politiqueſt and greateſt enemy, ſheathes the ſword, and works by poyſon, but not to the body; he hinders meetings under pretext of Treaſons againſt the State, and for publique ſafety ſets up Schools of Idolatry, and forces the Chriſtian children to be there trained, or elſ their parents dye as Traytors; Now, no longer Martyrs, this quailes many a courage, and was a great trouble and affliction to the Church; but they overcome God by prayer; here was the firſt tryal, and therefore need of the greater ſtrength; They ſtood in the firſt rankes of the bataile of the Lord Chriſt, and they were by him fitted accordingly for the combat they under went; fear of death, which to us is moſt terrible, was to them (unconverted) frequent, and therefore contemned; thus was courage by example given to them ſhould follow; there is alwaies a myſtery in providence, ſecretly fitting all things to that end the Lord determines, and works ſtill for the good of his people; and this preparation I take to be againſt the cruelty of the ſecond beaſt, which was to afflict the Church after the firſt beaſt (the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors) was taken away; the Apoſtles led the dance, and the holy Diſciples and Martyrs of all ſorts followed after, and that with the ſame faith and conſtancy, though through variety of Torments; and the perſecutions were ſo violent, that one of the learned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Ancient Paſtors of Gods Church Records, there was but one day in all the

The Dragon the perſecutor is now gone, and what doth reaſon ſuggeſt? Now they will ſerve God gloriouſly; before the ſervice was mean and contemptible, ſcorned by heathens, in private and ſecret, in a private houſe, nay Barn, Stable, Cave, or Grot; any where ſo they might but ſerve him at all, to live and praiſe him was all they looked for; they were in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in bondage before, the whips of the Task-maſters were upon their ſhoulders, or at beſt but in the wilderneſs, but now they enjoyed <hi>Canaan,</hi> the land of reſt, now build the Temple, hew the ſtones, lay the foundations, and erect not only chambers or lodgings for the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> but the Singers, the Porters, and all the train of due and orderly ſervice, and hearts were willing to the work, and then purſe and hand was ready, and now all on a ſuddain the whole world is turned Chriſtian, and all the provinces of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire crouch under the Standard of the Croſs; and the higheſt Purple adores the woaven Coat of our Saviour, and now the Pagan, according to his principles worſhips the riſing Sun; Thrive Chriſtian, and I am a Chriſtian, but otherwiſe adue Chriſt, and God, and all.</p>
                  <p>But they might go far who had ſuch excellent leaders, when their Emperor and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhewed in their exemplary life the power of Godlineſs, ſo that the difference was evident betwixt the ſincerity of Chriſtianity, and the vanity of Idolatry; for its report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that he was not ſo much a Conqueror of his enemies, through the power of faith, as of himſelf; all paſſions ſubjugated to the rule of his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105181:20"/> Saviour; he eat to live, and lived to magnifie his Saviour; and knowing he could never attain the height of that perfection which his Saviour had, and he aſpired not unto; yet as he had commanded, ſo he imitated and made him his rule and his pattern; his recreations were divine Contemplations; and his private diſcourſes betwixt God and his ſoul, were as Paradiſe to his ſoul; yea, ſuch was his diligent and awful conſtancie, that his Pavilion was his Oratory for divine Service, he would not neglect his hours of prayer, amid the greateſt dangers and troubles of warfare; yea ſuch was his zeal, that you could not diſtinguiſh whether he were the better ſouldier, or moſt excellent Preacher; and who would not haſte to be a Convert in this ſeaſon of bleſsings? and as his care was ſo wonderful for the ſoul; he neglected not to put in execution good Laws, and where need was, to make new; his care was for the weal of his people; he ſought his peoples good more then their Goods, and approved himſelf the common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Country by his ſea of bounty, which all pertook of freely; the Orphans not onely educated but maintained; to which he not onely employed the publike money, but out of his private Treaſury he afforded largely; he would relieve the neceſsitous begger, but cauſed to be ſought out the modeſt needy wretch; and comparing qualitie and neceſsity, he fitted and proportionated his bounty accordingly; ſo that to emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent vertue, he hath given entire poſſeſsions; yea, himſelf ſought out the deſolate, and afflicted; and all his Laws now taſted of the radiences which Converſion had gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in his ſoul, and were not onely moral, as agreable to Nature, but alſo Chriſtian, as ſavouring of that enlightment which our Saviour in his Preaching had given to the Law: and ſurely here was a glorious Court, where the Prince himſelf gave ſuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; how did the Nobles, the great, rich and powerful follow, eſpecially when the wiſe Emperor had fained a little inclination to Apoſtacie, and diſgraced the fawning paraſitical and hypocritical Courtier, and exalted and entruſted the faithful to Chriſt, though not obeying the Emperor; and it was indeed admirable, all was wonderful; the Fathers of the Church were the Emperors Councel, not out of their ambition, or his neceſſity, but to ſhew, his actions feared no Monitors, and his Councels ſhould be queſtioned by the ſtricteſt Chriſtians; and what might now be feared, was then reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: Thus did the Church flouriſh; but ſee here the devil was not conquered, though his Agents were; he now muſt go another way to work; a wily Serpent he is, &amp; can turn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into many folds, and therefore he now attemps new ways of tortures &amp; afflictions; and when the forraign enemies of the Church are beaten down and conquered, now he makes them enemies one to another; hitherto the common calamities had hindered the growth of diviſions; the Sword was the Lords avenger, he now ſuffers another; nay, Proſperity uſhers in Pride, Pride Ambition, and that Envy as well as Covetize; and out of all theſe ſprings up Arianiſm, the firſt great and ſpreading error to uſher in that fatall Apoſtacy ſo long before propheſied; and if we look into the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of it, or the foundation, it was Philoſophy, or ſearching into the ſecrets of the divine Decrees, and the reaſons of them, the <hi>Arcana</hi> of the Trinity, the extravagant curioſities of able, idle, and yet active wits, ſet on by the itch of vanity, and ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from the ignorance which they ſee in others; and the applauſe of novelty from ſuch as count all things wondrous that is above the ſphear of their own capacity; and this was the firſt comet of the kingdom of darkneſs, which in its growth threw darts of plagues and poiſons inſenſibly into the hearts and veins of the profeſſor of Chriſt in its glorious condition; which to remedy, there is by the Emperor a general Councel called; (note, that was the then unqueſtioned remedy) wherein though condemned by the power of mans Vote, yet nevertheleſs continued his ſtrength, and was not vanquiſhed; for the Emperors, and all at laſt ſubmitted unto this rage of the flood of error, untill God in his time, who orders the riſe, and fall, as laſting of all things, turned the ſtream into another channel: after by the Synod of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that hereſie was tollerated, by abſolution of the Patron, which the Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> had condemned; and by this tract of time, ſin growing ſpeedily, the Papacy began now to lay another ſtep to the grand defection; for the pride of the Paſtors was now grown ſo great, and the revenue ſo eminent, that the Fathers of the Church fight for the Papacy; and if the man-childe born, the Church, went into the Wilderneſs, that is, no ſooner did the Lord ceaſe afflicting his Church, and gave riches, and glory, and honor, but the purity and integrity of Ordinances ceaſed; and if you would finde Chriſt anywhere, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that were either in the Wilderneſs, thoſe holy ones that were through
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105181:20"/> acerbities paſt, ſo taught the vanity of the world, that nothing could bring them to the trial of the world again; or thoſe, that though they were in the City, were yet as in the Wilderneſs, ſuch as over whom the glories of the world had no power: Then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now the Church was not to be found, except the two witneſſes of the Lord, I mean the two Teſtaments were his Records; for if the Paſtors were thus changed, how might the people err? And ſurely from this time I count the Propheſie of Antichriſt began to be manifeſted, and the Apoſtacy and great defection to appear; for immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately under the reign of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger, when <hi>Alarick</hi> the <hi>Goth</hi> ſubdues <hi>Italy,</hi> and takes <hi>Rome, Soſimus</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> affects the title of Oecumenical, and claims as proper to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> That nothing in Eccleſiaſtick affairs ſhould be ordered without his conſent; the firſt linke of the chain of perdition. A non after riſes the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> hereſie, then the <hi>Eutichian:</hi> and thus the Lord puniſhes his Church now; before, the evil was the Sword; now Error, the greater plague of the two; then purity increaſed, now prophaneneſs; yet I cannot ſay ſo much prophaneneſs, for even the lives of the then Heriticks are a ſhame and condemnation to our preſent Chriſtians; yea, even in the defection of the Saints, how many humane excellencies appeared! what auſterity, what voluntary poverty, ſingular chaſtity, admirable conſtancie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd charity! And thus grew the glory of Chriſtianity, ſo that the Barbarous Nations, who were the ſcourges of Chriſtians ſins, were the admirers, and in ſome kinde the imitators of their piety; and it pleaſed God there was yet ſome wheat amidſt the field of the Church, excellent in all the qualities and ornaments needful in a diſciple of our Saviour; by whoſe induſtry and faithfulneſs great part of true Chriſtian purity was not onely continued, but alſo propagated, as well as errors and hereſies in great part vanquiſhed; ſo that the ſplendor of the Church of Chriſt was great and powerful; and ſo much the more, as for that the Church-men had now made ſome Quaeries concerning the power of the Emperors over them, as being the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt. And alſo of their power over Emperors, the Emperor being but a believer, they officers; he ſet apart, yet but for civil ends and Government; they for ſacred and divine: they begin the queſtion with the power of Calling, confirming, preſiding in, and adnulling Councels, and ended in dethroning Emperors; They who undertook the conteſt were wiſe and able; and though they oppoſed a powerful, yet it was a devout Emperor, and ſhaken with homebred and inteſtine afflictions, frequent in the decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtate of the Empire; this was heightened by what was then called zeal for Gods Altar; after that branded for ſpiritual pride, and accounted the higheſt ſtep to Antichriſtian error, opening the way to what ever followed with eaſe, placing an eſpecial ſanctity in ordination, from the Deacon to the Patriarch, and ſo to the Pope gradually; and in him, not onely to primacy, but ſupremacy; ſo that what was before evidenced by faith, and holy converſation, was now ſolely attributed to impoſition of hands; this was a holy unction, an indelible Character, marking who were Chriſts; God left not himſelf without witneſſes againſt theſe growing errors, in the ſeveral Ages, wherein they were propounded to the world, which gave ſome ſtop; but one error uſhering in another, ſtrengthened themſelves; ſo that at the laſt they ſhut truth out of doors. But to ſpeak of the particular errors upon the Quaeries ariſing among Chriſtians; Firſt, concerning the written Word of God, and word in general; of the written Word how we are to finde out the ſenſe, and know which is the true letter, whither it may be tranſlated, and whether a fit Judge of controverſie: Secondly, if not, who; concerning traditions, and the way of knowing them, which are Apoſtolical: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the properties, office and marks of the true Church: And ſo Fourthly, of the ground of faith; upon all which, with many more neceſſary and uſeful matters, the whole frame of unneceſſary ſuperſtitions, vain, ſinful, nay damnable doctrines ariſing in future time was founded: I cannot (at preſent at leaſt) intend any diſcuſſion, nor may it take ſo well with the generality of men, to have one whoſe ſtudy and profeſſion was the Law, though a Chriſtian, which general profeſsion I eſteem a full liberty to Quaery any ſo called Eccleſiaſtick, or Church contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie; but that indeed being not the main of my intention, I ſhall apply my ſelf to what is the ſcope of my undertaking in that way: The God of heaven, whoſe aid I implore, ſhall direct my ſpirit. The Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> now labour an addition of believers in all Countries, and not onely <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Almaine,</hi> but even the remoteſt Ilands of <hi>Britain</hi> receive the truth; the Church was to be univerſal, there
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105181:21"/> was a word of truth for it; But as the Emperors and Princes of the world had by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral experiences found out the beſt and quainteſt waies of ſtretching their ſubjects purſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings without cracking, to be the gains and in-comes of ſutes and controverſies, which being the vents either of malice in proſecution or victory in the iſſue, and the party overthrown, though miſerably complaining, were alwaies remedileſs, generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pittied, for it was done by Law, the rule of Juſtice; The Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> now begin generally to challenge to themſelves, not only for the honor, but for the neceſſity of order, ſpecial government by way of judicatories, at firſt only of matters ariſing within the precincts of his government as Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but after it extended by way of ſupremacy (the great injuſtice of all Princes giving colour thereto) to pluck away cauſes from the remoteſt parts of the world after the Biſhops had ſettled their powers, and by them courts in any kingdom, realm or nation; And from particular controverſie between perſon and perſon, Biſhop and Biſhop, he at laſt became the umpire of the controverſies of Kings, and by vertue of the neceſſity of a final appeal, he gave away kingdomes as he pleaſed, as the annals not only of <hi>Germany,</hi> but of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> do ſpecially commemorate; and now the name of univerſal Biſhop would not ſuffice, nor theſe large temporalities beſtowed upon them by Princes, but they ſeiſe the Cities of <hi>Romandiola, Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Bononia,</hi> and much more in the vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Empire; nay the little Horn would not reſt ſo contented; but the Emperors oppoſe; the Popes now produce the grounds of their actings, partly from reaſon, partly from Scripture, yet both agreeing in the ſubſtance, the neceſſity of an umpire in the Chriſtian Churches, that this abſolution muſt reſt in the Church, whereof Chriſt was the head, <hi>Peter</hi> his Vicar, and the Pope his, that all the kingdomes of the world were now the Lords and his Chriſts, that he gave them to whom he would, that this his Vicar was the moſt fit perſon, yea the only fit, if not deſigned, for he was the common father of ſouls, had the care of the Churches good upon him, that not only all were alike to him, but he bound alike to all the obligation too, the Church only excepted. This wrought conſcientiouſly in many, but actively in moſt, though ſuſpected of ſelf-ſeeking in ſome, covetize and avarice being the common error of great enjoyers, eſpecially in high and ambitious ſpirits; whereby the Pope was not without his Champions againſt all oppoſers; and as moſt pretenders do, they did ſome juſtice extraordinary at firſt; but when the notion of infallibility was accepted, who could oppoſe? now the Church was in its ruff, and now the whole world turned reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and all Nations, eſpecially in <hi>Europe,</hi> were become ſo great admirers of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an profeſſion, that they erected Monaſteries, Frieries, Nunneries, and men and women were engaged on all ſides, all worldly obligements neglected for the ſervice of their Saviour, husbands forſaking wives, and wives husbands; Children and Servants leave Parents and Maſters; nothing ſo ſecret which confeſſion could not unlock; there was eaſe and plenty; ſo that the Popes chair having ſo many feet, it was in no great fear of falling; but leaſt the people ſhould diſcern this, the foundation of all is laid upon the indubitable word, ſo called of God, of which they are the ſole Expoſitors, and this by way of anology or ſimilitude betwixt the old and new law; Therefore they hold forth, that as among the Prieſts one was cheif under the law, ſo alſo under the Goſpel; and as the Prieſts, ſo their lips muſt preſerve knowledge; as there was a bloody, ſo here was an unbloody ſacrifice; and as there was a Temple, ſo here another Church, inferior Churches, as the Synagogues; the times of ſacrifice are called Canonical hours, and all the officers and offices of the Jewiſh frame, are now brought into the Church, and though acknowledged ceremonial in themſelves, and ſo paſſed away, yet the myſtery of them opened, and the end relating to the ſervice of God and his Chriſt now, as before to God under his name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> was allowed as neceſſary for his better ſervice; and as the glory of the ſecond Temple was to exceed the glory of the firſt, ſo the maintenance of the miniſters of Chriſt, and the outward luſtre of ſervice, was to exceed it; but that they might fulfill the meaſure of iniquity, they bring in the uſe of Images firſt into the Church only, then for private devotion; this was contrary to the <hi>Jews</hi> order; but they anſwered firſt the <hi>Jews</hi> made pictures of falſe Gods, they of the true; the <hi>Jews</hi> in the ſhape of beaſts and other Creatures, theſe of man, and that after God appeared in the likeneſs of man; the <hi>Jews</hi> of God whom they had not ſeen, they of the Lord Chriſt; the <hi>Jews</hi> worſhiped the ſtock, the repreſentation; they had it only for a remembrance; but theſe admitted; now follow mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105181:21"/> which they call the ſign of the true Church; but that they might the better up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their Monarchy, they look not only to get ſome particular, as the moſt ordinary and uſeful cauſes, falling among men into their Juriſdiction, as probate of Wills, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of Marriages, tryals of Adultery and Fornication; but they labour to frame the Civil State according to the mode of their Eccleſiaſtick Hierarchy, whereby the one ſhould ſtand as a Bulwark to the other in the day of oppoſition: The word yields the foundation to reaſon, and reaſon of experience (joyned with the intereſt of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticers) confirms the the word; and even from this time there was the foundation of an intire and univerſal Monarchy among Chriſtians laid; for it was ſuppoſed as truth, that the Church of the Jew was the pattern and Type of all the Chriſtian Churches, that they were all to live as Brethren, both under the Eccleſiaſtick and civil Regiment; yea, that not onely between beleevers of the ſame Nation, but of the remoteſt parts of the world, there was ſuch a tye even by the right of profeſſion, that for their relief we ought not to plead too ſtrict a property in our goods, but freely to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to their neceſſities, whether the ſame were by reaſon of perſecution, or famine, or ſuch like, or other accidents of providence, and founded indeed the whole fabrick of their Government upon the rule, according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Model, and by degrees exterminating thoſe Laws which were ſpied to be diſadvantagious to their intereſt, and for the abſolute power of Princes, as they ſaw occaſion, from the troubles of the Empire, the weakneſs or religiouſneſs of the Emperours; indeed every thing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of times made way for the accompliſhment of the intended viſion: But this was no great piece of difficulty, for the nature of the matter led them eaſily to it, as it ſeemed; for the Laws even of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> from whom all Nations almoſt had received their general rule of Government, however at firſt miſhapen, and rude, yet after poliſhed by modelizing according to the rule of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Tables; and not only ſo, but of many or moſt of their judicials; for indeed, where can we have Laws more agreeable to natural equity, then the Almighty wiſdome there propoſed; ſo that the <hi>Arabians, Aegyptians, Aſians,</hi> yea, and the only not barbarous Greeks, founded or framed their generals upon, or according to that incomparable order, and in their miniſtrations did not much differ from the Hebrew originals; but this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that the whole body of Chriſtians was but one Commonwealth, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the head of all immediatly, the Lord Chriſt Jeſus; it ſeemed to follow by this, that he muſt have his ſubſtitutes on earth according to the nature of men, one as Prieſt, chief for the ſervice of him, to govern theſe men as Saints; another as King, who was to rule and govern them as men, according to the Law of God in righteouſneſs and holineſs; but all to be bound and looſed, as I ſaid before, by his mouth only who had the key of Knowledge, by a now received infallibility, which was without much difficulty effected. The Biſhops and Clergy-mens lives being yet not generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to ſcandall, many yet retaining a great deal of exemplary piety and purity, yea even in the boſome of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for although it be eaſie for particular and private perſons to ruſh ſuddenly and immediatly into great errour, yet for Commonwealths, or the publick Governors, or common Societies, 'tis not ſo; for what they look at, is Supremacy and uncontrolable Government; if ſo, the jealouſie which people ever have had of their liberties, will cauſe them rather to introduce things by degrees, then at once, and that ſo by little and little they may with eaſe obtain what by ſeeking at once they had utterly loſt. Thus did temporall Princes (for ſo we muſt diſtinguiſh while Biſhops are become Princes) by their Subjects, and thus did the Popes by them; but it is now fit to leave the general diſcourſe, and to reduce matters as intended, to a more narrow compaſs then the conſideration of the whole body of Chriſtians, and look at ſpecially this Nation of <hi>England,</hi> which now having received the Faith of the Lord Chriſt, whether under King <hi>Lucius</hi> primarily, or under any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, whether firſt preached here by <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Aramathea,</hi> or any other, whether Apoſtle or Diſciple of the Lord, but after more generally allowed, ſpread, or promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the coming of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monk from <hi>Rome,</hi> I ſhall not controvert, but allowing every man his opinion by whom firſt introduced, where firſt preached, and ſuch like; I ſhall take that only up which none will deny, which is, that about the time of <hi>Lucius,</hi> it was by publick and Magiſterial Authority firſt allowed, and hath more or leſs ever ſince been continued, embraced, and followed by ſome in this Nation at all times, but generally by the whole Nation, though
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105181:22"/> at firſt the over-running of ſtrange Nations might ſuſpend the ſplendor of it; onely thus much I muſt ſay, that 'its evident by hiſtory, that the Chriſtian Religion was here entertained and ſetled long before <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and that there were Monks particularly of <hi>Bangor,</hi> who profeſſed Chriſt, and lived according to the Diſcipline of our Saviours Doctrine, which grew now inconſiſtent with the dignity of the <hi>Romane</hi> Biſhop, and others with him, and all of the Clergy in their degrees; for now for the honour of Chriſt, as was pretended, there was to be more order, as it was called, to be obſerved among Chriſtians, which was meant of outward duty and obedience to the Popes Subſtitutes, in every place by the rule of gradation; for as the Pope repreſented Chriſt, having his power from him; ſo all Biſhops and inferiour Clergy ought to have and give their due reſpects from the people, and each from other, according to the places and truſts by his Supream Holineſs (whom they more or leſs immediately repreſented) repoſed and impoſed in and upon them. This obſervance <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monk ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; but the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or rather <hi>Britiſh</hi> Monks found not this in the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, nor preſidents of the Primitive Church; truth, they found examples of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more obſervance to holy men, then <hi>Auguſtine</hi> required or expected, but no way allowed, much leſs ſought by them to whom it was done, the Lord Chriſt never had nor required it, but himſelf waſhed his Apoſtles feet; and his Doctrine upon the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this caſe in controverſie was far otherwiſe, <hi>He that will rule, let him be ſervant, be not like the Princes of the world;</hi> but yet this as moſt cohering with naturall reaſon and the cuſtome of Princes (and that the decree might be fulfilled) was accepted by the Princes of the earth; and now the Crozier and the Crown went together in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for the Princes were generally zealous of the Law, after once admitted (it may be politickly, but I judge not) although that from the power of the <hi>Romanes</hi> here, ſo long ruling, there was a foundation laid of good and juſt Laws, and holding much conſonancy with the Judicials of <hi>Moſes;</hi> yet the many barbarous and irrational cuſtomes and uſages, eſpecially thoſe that were unchriſtian, were by the Kings, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of their people, aboliſhed and extinguiſhed; and there was one generall Law received, which was, That nothing was to be done, taken, or holden for Law, which was contrary to the Law of Almighty God, meaning the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which they took to be the ſpeciall Rule of Morall Wiſdom, and if once ſanctiated by the Biſhop, undenyable, if not infallible; and though it is like as in all other Ages, and places, the alterations of old and long received Laws, and introduction of new, was difficult and dangerous: yet this Age being a warring Age, and Souldiers little book learned, and yet the Princes of the earth, the vulgar people were far leſs, ſo that the many followed the mighty, and obedience was more pure then, then now, though more eaſie to be corrupted; ſo that the Kings beleeved the Biſhops, the Lords the King, and the people the Lords; and thus it was that whole Nations even on a ſudden became profeſſors of Chriſt, I ſay not Chriſtians; and though the Monks of <hi>Bangor</hi> would not, ſeeing the pride of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſubmit to him: yet the King converted, power effected what prayer would not; but this bred a worſe ſtir after; for theſe Monks ſtill living in their ſimplicity, and preaching faithfully, requiring nothing, but being contented with what the people gave, were more pleaſing to the people then they who were not only imperious and proud, but covetous alſo, ſo called, in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and enforcing Tythes, according to the Moſaical Law; and this was tryal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, for generally men love to be of that Religion that coſts them leaſt: Pariſhes were not yet known (they had not in theſe dayes, nor many hundred years after, ſuch clear light in Chriſts Diſcipline, as to finde that civil prudential thing in the book of Religion;) but men gave (who would give) their Tythes to the Miniſtry; theſe in each County, or Dioceſs, or Precinct (notwithſtanding all learned oppoſitions of the ſo called Clergy) were treaſured in common: the Biſhop, if any were, as the High Prieſt, or Prieſt, had his portion or Tythes out of the whole, and the Pope was to have his Tyth afterward, called <hi>Annate,</hi> or yearly Offering from him, beſides firſt fruits paid originally by every Miniſter or Monk (for they then generally were the Miniſters, though not only) to the Biſhop upon his introduction, and the Biſhop to the Pope, all pretending s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

So alſo was it in their Courts by way of gradation, admitting appeals, and that at laſt to the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which though upon the firſt ground each Prince ought to have allowed, yet ſome Princes finding the evils in time by alienating the hearts of their Subjects from them,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105181:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſubjugating purſe and perſon to a ſtranger; for ſo high theſe Popes at laſt went; other Princes ſpying the rents in other mens Dominions, avoided it in their own; ſo that they either never allowed, or ſought to avoid, if before admitted, ſuch appeals; upon this nevertheleſs at length ſprung up controverſies, not only between the Pope and other Princes, but alſo between the Princes of the Earth, in the reſpective Nations of the world, and the Biſhops: both alſo uſing the ſame arguments of duty and allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; the Pope by reaſon of being the Vicar of Chriſt, the King the ſame; the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was, the one was in Spirituals, the other in Temporals; this hath made the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops not only combine againſt their Soveraign for the Popes Cauſe, but even the people; for ſome pretending conſcience, have ſerved the Popes and Biſhops luſts againſt their Soveraign, and many times either for neceſſity, or neceſſitated by ſuperſtition, againſt their own as well as the Kings Intereſt: And thus by degrees what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality, as they termed themſelves, had obtained in other places, is granted in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and the marvaile was not ſo much at what was granted, but that no more was, when even the Crown it ſelf was holden in homage at laſt of the Popes Holineſs ſo called: And now were the people all fitted to receive even what ſhould be impoſed upon them. I cannot but obſerve again, that theſe Ages were very ignorant, ſo that the Church-men for want of others, were without ſcruple, commonly, if not generally, admitted the Seats of Judicature, in the ordinary Law Courts of the Kingdome, and were the prime men of the Kings Councel, ſo that there was nought to hinder, but only the pride and power of ſome warlike Noblemen, who in emulation ſtill oppoſed the Biſhops; and as the Age grew more knowing, began to ſtickle againſt them. But now the pride of <hi>Rome,</hi> come as it were to the higheſt pitch, even as all other things have their riſes, ſtops, and declinings, even ſo had this; but that it might not fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, nor want ſtrong ſupporters againſt the pride of Princes, which <hi>Rome</hi> thought would be ready to puſh at her, ſhe drives on a fury in ſpurring the people to depoſe their Princes, upon her Excommunications; the dire effect of which, all Chriſtian Nations ſo called, felt more or leſs, though more eſpecially <hi>Germany;</hi> ſo this our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and truly, the people might well be apt enough to it, for that moſt Princes had, as their Rights of Prerogative, taken from all but their Souldiers, whoſe ſwords up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them in their Majeſties, and ſo they upheld them in their acqueſts, be they good or bad, and from the Prieſthood, then generally ſo called, whoſe ſuperſtitions ſhould work an awe upon their ſpirits, all that could be called an immunity, much more the Rights of a free people, and that people ſhould be ſlaves to their Prince, is not found in Reaſons Leſſon, and that any prime Nation in Europe was the Conqueſt of any of their Kings I read not; true it is, <hi>Caſtile</hi> conquer'd all the reſt in <hi>Spain:</hi> ſo the <hi>French</hi> were reduced into one; ſo others, and ſo our <hi>England;</hi> the conquer'd yet in length of time enjoying almoſt like grace with their fellow Subjects; but with us in <hi>Wales</hi> we were made one: This cauſed oft and dangerous tumults, wherein ſtill a Prieſt bare his part; but things of long date being incertain, we ſhall now come to look at the laſt great mutation in this our <hi>England,</hi> and carry along the buſineſs of the Commonwealth from the time of <hi>William</hi> the firſt, ſirnamed the Conqueror, as princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally eying that, but with a reflex upon the matters of the Church, as being not to be neglected in reſpect of their own nature, and alſo for their neceſſity to the explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matters treated of; and I the rather chuſe to pitch upon that time, becauſe the hiſtories are more clear, and from that ſettlement do all the grand Quaeries flow which are now diſcuſſed by ſo many wits, and ſo many pens, wherein yet I ſhall be brief, as formerly, though laying the plot to the generality of the ſucceeding matter. <hi>William</hi> the firſt, commonly called the Conquerour, being the Baſtard ſon of the Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> having indeed no title at all to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> (I cannot ſay u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurps, he fought againſt an uſurper) yet layes claim to it only under a pretended and invalid promiſe of <hi>Edward</hi> late King of <hi>England,</hi> and with his Comrades, to whom he had promiſed ſhares in his purchaſe, He from <hi>Normandy,</hi> and with <hi>Normans,</hi> that is, <hi>Frenchmen</hi> of the Country, Province, or County of <hi>Normandy,</hi> lands in <hi>England,</hi> fights the then King, and ſlayes him in the Field; and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> diſtaſted at former Kings, and it ſeems doubtfull to whom the Crown belonged, and no one publikely laying claim, whereby it is probable the race was wom out, or utterly diſheartned: <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> ſoon ſettles himſelf, and by agreement with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to keep the Laws, or rule them according to their Laws, he is accepted as King; but as to avoid war, the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105181:23"/> ſtrengths of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being yet in no conſiderable manner broken by the one battel with the ſlain King, he pretends his Title of Donation, Adoption, or what you will call ſuch a pretence; yet he, as he found occaſion and opportunity, not only ſtrengthned himſelf, but weakned the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that inſenſibly, depoſing all Biſhops of whoſe fidelity he was not aſſured; and for ſetling a new form of Government upon, yet exceeding prudent grounds, which was the ſo called Tenure in <hi>Capite,</hi> or of the Crown, he by cutting off the Males of the chief Nobles as Traitors, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Females where they were, in marriage to his <hi>Normans,</hi> and the other upon ſeiſures, he granted, to hold of him, as of his Crown; thus he wrought his own ends every way; for now he hereby takes the power of the Kingdom, and the adherences of the ancient Nobility into the <hi>Norman</hi> Race; his <hi>Normans</hi> now, as by agreement, and according to the rule of their Nation, take all from him, who is Lord paramount. Thus all the land in <hi>England</hi> is holden of the King, and by the equity of the judicial, he hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all of God onely, and ſo the land was abſolutely enſlaved, and the title of warlike conqueſt is atchieved by a quiet bargain; for this marriage of the inheritrix, all other objects taken away, caſt the tenants eyes ſolely upon the enjoyer of their Lady; now this way was prepared to before, the kingdom being formerly divided, not onely into Counties, under an Earl, Conſul, or their Sheriff, but each County into their Hundreds, and thoſe ſubdivided into half Hundreds, and thoſe again into Tythings; the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Law that ever was in point of prudence directed even by the infinite Wiſdom to the <hi>Jew,</hi> and approved by theſe men, as obligatory to Chriſtians, or ſo pretending; theſe in their gradations all had their law from their Lord, and held of him, moſt under an oath, and that according to the nature of the Tenures, whether by homage or fealty, onely with a ſaving of right to the King and other Lords, and that Lord he held of the King: nay, the wiſe Baſtard had a further reach; for theſe Land-tenants were his <hi>Militia,</hi> and none elſe were now ſuffered to have Arms, ſo that his <hi>Normans</hi> being conveniently diſpoſed into all parts of the Nation, and the Nation thus engaged by theſe courſes aforeſaid, being more warlike then wiſe, few then knowing more then the Prieſt told them, the work was readily effected; and ſo much the rather, becauſe the Nobles had Knights held of them by the like ſervice of attendance in the wars; ſome holding Honors, and ſome Mannors in ſubordination; and theſe again had Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders for the proviſion of their houſes, which was called the ſervice of the plough; And thus all being diſtinguiſhed into their orders and ranks, there was nouriſhed by theſe mutual dependances, love and duty, ſervice and ſuſtenance; the Noble man being at Court, the Lord or chief Knight in the County, the Patrons of the Yeomonry, and all yet held in chief of the King: This prudent ſettlement holding a correſpondence with the ancient <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> and no difference from the later <hi>Romane</hi> Government, both here by ſeverall Governors and Governments made native, was very facile to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; and the rather, becauſe that our rocks of offence now, were no ſtumbling ſtones of offence then, but the foundation-ſtone of the ladder of the higheſt preferments; for the Kingdom being ſettled upon a Military frame, yet wiſely obſerving the rules of humane Arts, Wardſhip and Marriage, the now or late Bugbears were thus laid and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by that diſcreet Prince, following ſo juſtly and evenly one upon the neck of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by them accounted demonſtrative reaſon; that truly his enemies approved at laſt what his friends denied; that is, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> admitted what the <hi>Normans</hi> ſpurned at; for as I find the Kingdom being put into this Sword poſture, it was thought meet that the Tenants of the King, who were not fit to do him ſervice, ſhould be under his tuition; and who would and could ſo carefully provide, both for their training in warlike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, or diſpoſe them in marriage for his ſafety, and their well-being as the Prince, whoſe ſtrength and ſecuriry they were to be both in war and peace? ſo that Lords to their Knights, and they to their Eſquires, and all to their Soccagers; ſo that Soccagers, or Freeholders ſought a Tenancy in Knights Service; and they by Knights Service ſought to hold of the King, not in <hi>Capite</hi> only, but by the greater ſervices of Petite and grand Serjeantie, being ſo much the more or leſs honorable, as they were directed more or leſs immediatly to the perſon of the King: And I do not finde that King <hi>William</hi> did create more Lords then there were Counties; for he obſerved his plot of Government, as I may ſay once for all, intermingling the old and his new with ſuch a fit contexture, as the firſt glance or preſent witneſſes did not eaſily diſcern it: Now as he laid his Military part wiſely, ſo did he not indiſcretely ſettle the Civil part, for that he

                  <p>Now the King plots his own ſetlement; firſt, as being a <hi>Norman,</hi> that is, <hi>French;</hi> he wills all our pleadings to be in <hi>French;</hi> for he being as chief Father of the Commonwealth, to ſee to all, ought to underſtand it; Next, he ought eſpecially for offences criminal, or treſpaſſes of force voluntary, to have the puniſhment of the offender, as a diſturber of the peace of the Commonwealth, as well as the particular party to have reparations; and therefore he brings in, together with Appeals, the ancient uſage of <hi>England,</hi> which was the challenging of a man to have committed an offence, as of treaſon, murder, rape, felony, and the like; a kinde of ſuit in the name of the King, called an Indictment; and truly all the reaſon of the introduction that I can ſee, was to advance the end of the Kings gain; for here the King hath all the gain; all the goods of the party (at firſt) from the day of the offence done; truth, now he hath it in appeal; but it was not ſo; for this, the old true tale of <hi>Kents</hi> freedom will be known Evidence; for they oppoſed this part of prerogative; and then the father to the bough, that is, to be hanged upon the arm of a tree, the uſual and ready way then of diſpatch, and the ſon to the plough, that is, to the improving the inheritance left: Concerning the common Law, Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of a Prince, or what the Laws of <hi>England</hi> anciently, as by the right and light of natural knowledge, granted to their Kings, a certainty of land of the Crown, Mines of gold and ſilver, Royal fiſhes, lands deſerted of the ſea, and of them who died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heir, as the prime perſon in whom the honor and glory of the people reſted, I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ſpeak at preſent: Truly that this <hi>William</hi> uſed Parliaments, I finde not, though others do; for it is evident to the world, and he that is not blinde may ſee; he to quiet the people, pretended Title; but his intention was to make it his abſolute conqueſt; he therefore calls Councels, where his Lords were preſent; they do what his Will is, and there is an end; So that grant it a Parliament, or National Aſſembly of the Eſtates, yet it was but to grant or enact what the King deſired; his <hi>Normands</hi> had liberty to ſpeak their will, what Engliſh man durſt oppoſe? but the acts of his ſucceſſor fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate this; who deſtroys thirty towns and Churches to make a Forreſt: the Monks of the time durſt ſpeak, but who elſe? So that now it was evident what Title he claimed by, pretend he what he will; for the King had ſtill his pretences; truly the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were now in great ſtreights, they ſaw their Laws utterly aboliſhed, and their lives and eſtates to lye at the Kings mercy; there was no remedy to complain, who durſt? The Biſhops yet notwithſtanding ſomething interpoſe, but their mouthes are ſtopped by a command from his Holineſs; for people muſt not riſe againſt their Prince, but at his will; and fill his coffer, and you have his Croſier at command; for <hi>Rome</hi> was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105181:24"/> now at the full height of wickedneſs; but God taking away this ſacrilegious Prince, he ſoon opens a way of comfort, to the almoſt cowed <hi>Engliſh,</hi> giving them ſome means of revenge by a royall conteſt or a quarrel for the Crown: this, and matters of like nature ſetled, there now ariſeth a greater quarrel, which hath continued even to theſe times, though with divers parties, and upon ſeveral grounds; and that was betwixt the Lords and the King; it ſeems God would have the <hi>Engliſh</hi> free, and though he chaſtiſed them, he would not forſake them; for he makes their enemies the chief aſſertors of their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Liberties; for theſe Lords finde now that they had not the ſame free priviledges their Anceſtors had and claimed; their births had now made them Engliſh; &amp; of ſharers in principallity, they were made meer, though greater Subjects; The King Lawyers belike had found ſome flawes in their patents, it may be they had done ſome wrong to their Tenants; and were complayned of; and the King to anger them, that they might forfeit their too large liberties, did the poor men right, the greateſt vexation and Soul or heart-grief a proud great man can have; but be the ground what it will, many of which are evident, and ariſing as before is ſaid; The conteſt grew high; there were things called Parliaments aſſembled, to the end to determine theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and in them divers good Laws tending to reconciliation were enacted; but what was the effect of force, ceaſed in execution, when the cauſe was removed; and the Lords armed againſt their Princes; and truly their Tenants took part as the reſt did, they feared the ſaving of their faith to their King would prove the forfeiture of their lands to their Lords; and now what was intended for the Kings ſafeguard, was his ruine; the moſt immediate Lord carrying all the power, the ſuperior Lords all along were ſtrangers; So vain a thing is the moſt prudent ſettlement of men, if Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence affords not ſucceſs: But this ſtill remains a ſure foundation, good Laws are ever the ſame, though the badneſs of men may enervate and weaken them, yea oft times invert them; but ſtill as differences grew higher and higher, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were the means of quieting of all, which doth clearly evince that thoſe national meetings were, and are, not only the moſt natural and prudent means of compoſure of civil differences, but alſo proper to this Nation, the due rights of which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies contended for; This conteſt wrung away from the King thoſe two great Charters of priviledge called <hi>Magna charta &amp; charta de foreſta,</hi> being the expreſs limit and boundary of the Prince, that he might not upon occaſion fly out after upon his title of conqueſt; the ſubject matter of them are evident to each mans veiw, they are generally conſonant (none contrary) to right reaſon, they are reſtraints of the Princes abſolute will, or of Governing according to his own luſt, and declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the ſubject what he might truſt to, eſtabliſhing indeed the right of property, <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> againſt that high point of levelling (which the Princes of this Land, as of all other Nations ſought after) not only the great men, Mountains, Lords, but even the Mole-hills, the meaneſt Subjects, to the nod, beck, word of this man God the King; The Lords, and others ſaw this; wherefore they bound the King by oath, but what coard is able to hold a covetous, much leſs an Ambitious ſpirit? firſt therefore they plead dureſs, or conſtraint; and I muſt ingenuouſly acknowledge there was force againſt force, another King confirming it in his minority, or under the Age of twenty one years; he thinks this a looſe to his oath, as if he were old enough to vow, but not to perform; and to theſe refuges of the Princes the Lawyer could give excellent colours; and now the maſter-piece was to ſet the work afoot in a legal way, and the Judges of the land were to determine this part; they were ſworn to the King, and therefore they muſt give their advice and afford their beſt aſſiſtance to him; the hiſtories publike ſay it was an enforced opinion, whereby they annihilated all the principal priviledges in the grand Charter, putting at once the ſword and purſe of the kingdom into the Kings hand, upon neceſſity, making him to be judge of the neceſſity, for the great truſt repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in him as King, for the benefit of the Common-wealth, and of this faithfulneſs there muſt be no doubt; this was in the time of a weak wilful yong Prince; ſo that the Lords in Parliament (for who elſe durſt budge or ſtir?) queſtion the Judges as betraiers of their truſts, and the liberties of the people; and make them examples by hanging them at the common Gallows. There were then men whoſe judgements and opinions were as abſolute for this King and his actions, theſe men and their determinations, as might be; who cried out upon the Lords and the Parliament, as Rebels, Subverters of the Law, the ſetled Law, and that by the opinion of ſworn men, the Judges, magnifying the King
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105181:24"/> as one that did but intend to take away the Root, Spawn and ſeed-plot of Rebellion; for while a power of conteſt or viſible cauſe thereof remained (which theſe Charters had often manifeſted themſelves to be) there would be no viſible ſecurity for a ſetled peace; if the Lords might judge of one right or privilidge of one part of the Kings prerogative, why not of all? if ſo, as good be no King; this was the Court dialect, and of their dependants; and this controverſie ceaſed not till at laſt the King had ruined all the power of the Lords, and now all was ſafe; the Kings therefore to divert the ſtream of affection in the people, from ſeeing into the invaſion of their liberties, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Wars in <hi>France,</hi> wherein being ſucceſsful, they pleaſe the people with ſmal things, and take away great, but eſpecially curtail the Lords of that abſolute depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance which was upon them by their under-Tenants, granting the uſe of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the other Charter as Law, but breaking it upon all occaſions in times of War, and then complying in times of peace; and truly this was the State of <hi>England</hi> for the ſpace of about three hundred years after the Conqueſt.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, why did the Pope ſuffer this? why did not he as the common and ſpiritual father of the whole Chriſtian flock, uſe his power both over the great Ram the King, and the leſſer cattel and younglings of the flock? what, ſuch devaſtations, murderings, perjuries, and other evils, as muſt of neceſſity follow ſo many Warlike conflicts? under Chriſts kingdom the Lion and the Lamb were to feed together, and the Wolf and the Kid to lie or couch together.</p>
                  <p>Truly the Pope had ever an Oare in the Boat of the Common-wealth. But know, <hi>Rome</hi> was now the Princeſs and Queen of Power, ſhe raiſed up the people, to ſcourge Princes diſobedient to her, not thoſe obedient; they ſhould whip the people to the bare bones; and this juggling appeared, and there were open complaints even to Princes againſt the Vicar of Chriſt; But as the Princes to appeaſe their Subjects, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound War againſt a neighbour Prince, yea though Chriſtian; for now great men and Princes being become Chriſtians, it was hard to know whether Chriſtians were Chriſtians yea or not, their actions were ſo far different from their profeſſions; So the Popes to take the Chriſtian Princes off of their intentions to look into his Court and cuſtomes, propound War againſt <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> a holy and ſpecious pretence, to redeem <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> from the hands of heathens, ſtill the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> pattern; by this he hath a double advantage, for his, chief Enemies gone, that is the moſt active and moſt zealous Princes for reformation, he propounds the ſame to others, but diſcharges them of their oath, (for they that went did ſo) for many others he employed againſt his private Enemies, that is; Enemies of his leudneſs, wickedneſs, and apoſtacy from the faith of God, (the Kings of the earth making a league with the whore, and drinking of the cup of her fornications (and ſhall no doubt of her deſtruction alſo) ſo that they who ſhould and ought, being taken off from puniſhing her) God raiſed up poor deſpicable Creatures, yea taught Babes and Sucklings to vindicate his truth, as the ſo called <hi>Waldenſes, Albingenſes,</hi> poor men of <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and boundaries of <hi>Italy; Wickliff</hi> with us, <hi>John Huz</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> with the <hi>Germans,</hi> and others with others, thouſands of which the Pope in the teritories of <hi>France</hi> cauſed to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by ſouldiers ſworn for <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> Now as the Popedome was corrupted, ſo was the generality of all the Biſhops, Doctors, and Prieſts in all places; they had an abundance of riches, fat paunches, and lean pates, they had now found out an eaſie method of ſerving Chriſt; they were in the years of the Churches proſperity, that themſelves agree, and we believe; that was the great reaſon they took ſo little pains; The Kings had reſerved donations of Biſhopricks to themſelves, and riches and honor (the nourſes of eaſe) were what all ſtrove for; theſe dependances held the generality cloſe to the Kings; if any oppoſed, it was pride ſtirred up anger, that they were omitted, and others either preferred before, or above them; yet even in this time the name of religion was venerable; and truly the faith of many, or rather the credulity or ſuperſtition of moſt, with abundant charity was everywhere perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous; love of God drew ſome; but Pride, Luſt, Covetize, Ambition, Eaſe and ſuch like drew a multitude; to ſpeak of the multitude of vain and ſuperſtitious attractives, I count needleſs, as fitting rather itching ears then ſolid heads; yet this gangrene over ſpred the whole body of the Chriſtian Common-wealth, and it was no miracle, for miracles were become common, and now the Church ſlept in greater ſecurity then before; for who durſt oppoſe the word of the Pope, and the ſword of Princes?
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105181:25"/> for ſeeing fire and faggot, the ax and halter were now in the hands of the chief Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, what cauſe of fear to the ſervants of Chriſt, and what need the Kings fear if they had the Pope to their friend? yet divers of them repined, ſeeing ſo much of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall eſtate each day ſlipt away under Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, ſo called, as that in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>England,</hi> when it was complained of in Parliament, that the third part of the Land and revenue of the whole kingdome, was in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens hands, and it was petitioned to take ſome away, the firſt publick act of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> againſt the juriſdiction and eſtate of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> although in the caſe of <hi>Johns</hi> grant of the kingdome to the Pope, to hold in fee of him: The Lords diſ-owned the power of the king to grant, as having no more but a truſt in the kingdome; but they did not hint that his Holineſs could not take, and it was vain when they ſaw he gaped for more then he took, and took more then was his due. The ſucceeding Kings were either ſo given to forreign wars, or troubled with the inteſtine diviſions of the houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> that now they were forced to own Parliaments, yea to take the chief ſtrength of their Title from their determinations: There had been a Law made formerly, to have Parliaments once a year; for as the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ſought to avoid thoſe publick conventions of the moſt potent Lords and popular Commons, for divers moſt evident reaſons as they conceived, (and upon their unjuſt grounds truly) deſtructive to their Royalty; for there their actions were continually queſtioned; the actors by perſonal command of the Kings againſt Law, or labouring the aboliſhing the Laws, either fined, or hanged, or otherwiſe puniſhed; and though ſome Parliaments went croſs to others, ſome even juſtifying the acts of kings againſt Law, and their abettors; this invalidates not the power of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but confirms it; for by theſe Acts the kings after made Title; ſo that here the Parliament got into their hands, and that upon motion of the kings, even the power of appointing the king; and this aroſe from that bloody contention between thoſe two houſes: But you will ask, was not the Title clear? yes, without doubt; but the Eſtates, that is the Parliament, upon the great diſlike of the preſent Government, their hearts being alienated from a diſſolute and riotous Prince, ſought out the man among them of the Race, with whom the potent men could drive the beſt bargains, for Riches, Honor, and promotion; and ever or moſtly, though the love and zeal of the Laws, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but eſpecially of Religion, gave the firſt blow to the quarrel, and ſuited it; yet intereſt eſpouſed, wedded, owned and enjoyed it; ſo eaſie are the beſt natures to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and depraved by outward excellencies, or eſteemed excellent things.</p>
                  <p>But it may be Quaeried, what all the ſucceſſion of Princes all this while did for the Church? truly all they could both by themſelves and Subjects, multitudes of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Monaſteries, Fryeries, Nunneries, Abbies, Chappels, all planted in the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant delicious places of the Nation, admirable and coſtly ſtructures richly furniſhed, largely endowed, both with lands and yearly profits of Tythes, onely to ſend a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to preach; and now the common maintenance of the Church or Church-men ceaſed, and was made proper, and after was drawn into that civil order, which we now call a Pariſh, being a limitation of the bounds of the Church, for care of ſouls and maintenance; and though indeed there was ſo great a ſufficiency, yet even then many of the Clergy were in want; it may be the Pope thought it fit ſome of Chriſts Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhould be like their Maſter; I mean of that ſo called, and juſtly at firſt, the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> Order, according to their ſtile, commonly called the Begging Fryers; for ſo they did upon conſcience of the Rule of our Saviour, Go forth into all the world, take no care for any thing, one coat, no money, not a ſtaffe, no nor ſandalls; theſe went bare-foot, preached diligently, expecting onely what God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved peoples hearts to beſtow upon them; for they beleeved, that God that ſaid, The labourer is worthy of his hire, would not ſuffer them while they laboured to want. That <hi>Rome</hi> teſtified againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> admitting truth for truth, though living in Errour; yea, many of theſe preached againſt the Errours, I ſay not of the Church, but of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> wiſely as it was beleeved, covering their mothers nakedneſs with the Fig-leaves of their temporal acqueſts; but all were not ſo politick, ſome ſpake plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in all Ages, and preached <hi>Rome</hi> Babylon, and the Pope Antichriſt; and it might well be; for <hi>Rome</hi> come to the height of outward greatneſs (ſo that the Mahumetans, who look for an earthly Paradiſe excelling and abounding in all carnall delicacies could not have deſired more) it fell into the ſink of enormity,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105181:25"/> all debauchery, riotouſneſs and prophaneneſs, and exalted it ſelf not onely againſt God, kicking with the heel now ſhe was fat, but above God, under the power of the Keyes; for ſhe diſpenſed with the very Commandments of the Almighty, giving li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, not onely to unlawful, but even to inceſtuous marriages, which hath filled Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, ſo called, with all thoſe horrible and direful effects of wrath, upon all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which now of late years have fallen out, eſpecially upon the Kings, Princes, and great men, the great Merchants, whoſe luſts would admit no denyal, and ſo traded with this ſpirituall harlot, for ſome of her traſh and paint, to give a colour to all their inceſts, murders, perjuries, lyes, adulteries, rapines, thefts, extortions, and ſuch like; and let all the families of Europe look to themſelves, they boaſt to be deſcended of Kings, ally'd to all the great Princes of Europe; but have they not therewith an allyance to the judgement, which will, it is probable, follow theſe ſins, till the blot be utterly worn out? and let them look to it, they hold not but by this beaſt, and will be deſtroyed with her: miſtake not, I ſay not all Kings, or kingly power, or Rule, or Government, but the iſſue of Inceſt, and the ſpawn of unlawfull Luſts.</p>
                  <p>I muſt now return to the civill State, where the Kings as I tell you, ſtill laboured to maintain their Prerogative, ſo called, by which they intended the abſolute rule of their will, holding all that was yielded by the Law, not as <hi>datum,</hi> or given, but <hi>debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi> therefore they refuſed it not, but laboured to encroach, and therefore there was no immunity granted to the Subject, but they paid for it; no right cleared, but bought at the hardeſt market; yet upon theſe chaffers the Kings ſettle the Courts of Judicature, both of the Common Pleas, Kings-Bench, Exchequer, and appoint Judges and ſalaries at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> a certain place, and at certain and appointed times, whereby the great and arduous cauſes, the difficulties of which could not be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ordinary Judges of the County, might by theſe eminent and moſt learned, or ſo eſteemed, receive a period with leſs charge to the Subject, and to theſe were appointed Officers and Fees: After this the Chancery was ſetled, and the chief Judges of all theſe Courts, I have read, the Parliament were to appoint, and they might if Annuall; but if but every ſeven years, as by after agreement was eſtabliſhed, it was requiſite to admit the king the choyce once, and then to be ſure he was like to keep it for ever, (there was a preſident) out of theſe Courts the kings raiſed large ſupports; for all the Officers which were now multiplyed, went all along with the Crown; and yet theſe Courts the kings liked not, but laboured to introduce other Courts, the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of all theſe Judicatories by way of gradation, admitting a finall appeal to Parliament in courſe; therefore the Court of Wards is erected, and that upon a good colour, but a bad cauſe; for the latter kings having ſeen the iſſues of things before, as is related, now neglected the warlike education, and the preferment of their Wards, as at firſt inſtitution; indeed the cauſe which was then, that was the putting by degrees the whole power of the Land by Marriages, was now ceaſed; and now none bare leſs affection to the king, then the race of <hi>Normans,</hi> the iſſue being like in condition with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ill brooking the ſervice and vaſſalage which themſelves laboured to lay upon the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this Court came up the Court, ſo called, of Star-Chamber, intended ſtill as a bridle to curb the head-ſtrong humours of the Lords and great men.</p>
                  <p>There were erected Courts of Admiralty, and all theſe Courts were bounded, had their Rules in all circumſtances; the defects of which were ſtill, as I ſaid, lyable to appeal, that is, to be queſtioned in Parliament; the Law Courts, and Statutes, Courts of courſe, the other agreeable to their own nature by ſupremacy of power; neither were the Spiritual Courts ſo called, that is, the Courts of, or under, or by, or from the juriſdiction, power, authority of the ſo called Clergy, from the higheſt Biſhop to the meaneſt Surrogate of other ſettlement; yet in theſe the Kings were chary; for they appealing to the Pope, a curſe might follow; and who that hath a due conſideration of conſcience, can blame the Princes, Judges, Magiſtrates and Officers of thoſe times, ſeeing they pretended to beleeve the Popes Supremacy of power, and all other things conducing thereto?</p>
                  <p>But now we ſhall ſee a ſtronger oppoſition to the Pope then ever; for he ſending out many prophane Indulgences, as for pardoning of the greateſt offences, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105181:26"/> tolerating the higheſt wickedneſſes, <hi>Luther</hi> a Popeling oppoſes, and that openly before the Emperour, at the great meeting or Parliament of the Princes of the Empire, many of which took part with him; he thus upheld, and the Pope ſcorning the check by a paultry Fryer, he curſes and excommunicates him; <hi>Luther</hi> writes againſt that, and ſeeking and ſearching the Scriptures to find out how to aſſure the truths he had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, God manifeſts many more.</p>
                  <p>Now here I muſt obſerve, that <hi>Luther</hi> broached no new matters, it was the old Scriptures, and the old truths of the Scripture; but the men that then lived, thought it then ſtrange, and novelty, as being contrary to what they had been trained up in. Of all the forreign Princes to <hi>Germany,</hi> who ſtickled in this buſineſs, none ſo hot as the king of our <hi>England,</hi> then called <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, a Prince not eſteemed ſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious as Warlike, nor approved ſo Warlike as fierce, every violent ſpirit not being for the management of Military Atchievments; and to ſpeak the truth, the eaſe and delicacy of Court breeding, imbecillitates the mind, and enervates the body for the pains, care, and danger of War: This king nevertheleſs, had ſure ſome deſign in his head, to gain his Holy Fathers good will in, as other Princes; he therefore writes, or cauſes to be written, which he fathered, a Book againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> in maintaining the Popes power, yea even in the unjuſteſt matters; that is, That <hi>Luther,</hi> a Vaſſal of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> a Child of the Church, ought not to judge the Fathers acts, nor cenſure, much leſs controul matters allowed by him, much leſs authorized, nay commanded; for the bearer of the Indulgences had his Letters miſſory, or Bull, ſo called. <hi>Luther</hi> bears this ſhock, and all and alone ſtands the dint of the whole, ſo called, Chriſtian world, a few men, and one or two inferiour Princes, with an univerſity, excepted; but this notwithſtanding, <hi>Luther</hi> teaching and holding forth the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, fears not, and multitudes are converted (I may ſay to the Faith) from the Pope to him, he appealing to a general Councel; but the Princes oppoſe with the Emperour, as well as our <hi>Henry;</hi> and good reaſon, as I before declared, ſet the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel to order the Popes matters, and a Parliament or Dyet will by Analogical Rule argue, at leaſt (rationate at firſt, and at laſt determine) of the rule of Princes; let a Fryer queſtion the Pope, and any Subject may as well altercate with his Prince, and at laſt appeal to a Parliament, as <hi>Luther</hi> to a Councel; truly all the irregular Intereſts of Popes, Cardinals, Biſhops, Prieſts, and the reſt of that rabble, and of kings, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Judges, Advocates, as Lawyers and the reſt hang upon one thread; and I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that one ſword at one blow cuts at laſt both aſunder; aſſuredly as they have ſtood, ſo they will fall together; but mark Gods way; our <hi>Henry</hi> was a diſſolute young Prince, and he married young, and to a widdow, nauſeous to ſuch a ſpirit, vain, though Heroick, or magnanimous, to give it the beſt among ſuch epithites; he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of a divorce, which he at firſt at leaſt ſought, not ſo much (as is moſt probable) for conſcience, as humour ſake; for this change he ſeeks the Popes diſpenſation; ſhe was a daughter of <hi>Spain,</hi> the elder ſon of the Church, that is, the moſt ambitious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſo called, Chriſtian Princes, which now ſtood ready at all aſſayes to act the Popes pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>He was nigh and potent, and muſt not be diſpleaſed; the Pope dallies, puts the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> king, deſirous and hoping of a divorce, upon an injury to his Crown, as it is at laſt reſented, by making him in a private manner, as a ſubject to the Pope, appear before his Legat to anſwer his fact.</p>
                  <p>Truth is, the very Court of <hi>England</hi> was now tainted with <hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the kings Book, and theſe men taking opportunitie of the kings wrath, blow it up to ingratiate themſelves and advance their intereſts, by ſubverting their enemies, they inſtill into the kings eare, a Rhetorick pleaſing enough to a high and angry ſpirit; namely, that he had no dependance on the Pope, his Royalme was free: True, his predeceſſors either of weak Title at firſt, or controvertible at laſt, of weak parts, or in a turbulent State, either durſt not, or did not openly oppoſe, yet truly did what they could to extinguiſh that power that they beleeved uſurped: The king upon this, reſolves to proceed without the Pope, and at laſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving experienced many wayes, receives ſatisfaction, and withall, to deſpight the Pope, renounces his Supremacie, and gains it Enacted by Parliament.</p>
                  <p>But to ſhew his zeal to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion; he continues the Act, ſo called, of the ſix Article, a moſt bloody and Popiſh device, and executes it, by which two conttary
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105181:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> Acts, a Papiſt is burnt for denying the Kings Supremacy, and a Proteſtant for affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pope Antichriſt, and ſuch other matter, both at one and the ſame Stake; ſo that it was evident, this Prince ſought not the honour of Chriſt, but his own intereſt; but this foundation laid, he proceeds a ſtep further, which enlightens this ſomewhat more; for the Pope, who thought he had as good hold in all his Chriſtendome, ſo called, as <hi>Henry</hi> had in <hi>England,</hi> he firſt cites, then excommunicates him; but this Prince all fire by his Colleague in Arms <hi>Bourbon</hi> aſſaults; and, had not <hi>Woolſey</hi> been truer to <hi>Rome</hi> then to <hi>England,</hi> had had the Pope his Captive; but money not coming timely enough hinders that; but he that regards not the father neglects the ſon; <hi>Henry</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore throughly angred, finds ſome default in the great Church-men, moſt obvious to Law, and leaſt favoured of the people, and not at all owned in the word of God, as were Biſhops, Paſtors, Prieſts, and Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>He therefore feiſeth the rich Abbies, Monaſteries, Nunneries and Frieries; and as before the Knights Templers once faln had many ſins laid to their charge, which it was believed they never did; ſo theſe had many ſins found, which it was proved they might well be charged withall, which but few ever believed of them, as Sodomy, Beaſtiality, Murder, and the like; for Adulteries and whoredoms they were known, and he juſtified his actions by the actions of the late named Cardinal <hi>Woolſey,</hi> who had, as he ſaid, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed little Monaſteries to build a great Colledge; and he deſtroyed great ones to ſupport a noble Kingdom; intimating, that he found that theſe would be his enemies in his conteſt againſt the Pope, to whom they were more ſurely tied then to him; ſo that in caſe contention came, this was ſo provided for, as a dangerous fire hid within his own bowels; the lands he exchanged with his Lords, Nobles, and Servants at eaſie rates, whereby he was little advantaged, and they highly obliged, whereby he got faſt friends againſt the Papal power; and they that would not exchange, were noted as favorers of the Pope; and from this change firſt aroſe our Lay-preachers, or Impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators ſo called: See how God works his ends againſt his enemies, not a title of, or for God intended, and yet his work done; and <hi>Henry</hi> hath the glory of the firſt Reformer, yea, and his Declarations pronounced no leſs then zeal for Gods Glory; but what he truly had, others as truly deſerved in his Court, whoſe faithfulneſs to their Prince, and zeal for Gods Houſe, yet at laſt by the malignity, even of the contrary faction, was, when his ſervice was ended, and the Kings coffers full, rewarded with an Axe, ſuch fickle things are Princes, the ſons of men; and this is the promiſe of the faithful in this world of affliction, in the life to come eternal felicity: this was the firſt turn of the wheel of wrath againſt theſe Apoſtates from the purity of the Goſpel, and the practiſe of the Goſpel; having left the Service of Chriſt to ſerve themſelves in the honors, riches, glories, pomps and vanities of the world, luſts of the fleſh, and pride of life; and now as wave ſucceeds wave, ſo doth ſorrow, ſorrows to theſe children of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for the ſon makes clean work, and hardly leaves a handful of Popelins in <hi>England;</hi> and this was preſumed to favor more of conſcience, becauſe they ſaw not the hire of the work, there was little pay for their pains; but he of ſhort continuance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mary,</hi> though born in unlawful wedlock, was, notwithſtanding the Will of the laſt King, or the Acts of Parliament for diſinabling of her, through the potency of the Popiſh party, yet by Parliament, advanced to the Throne.</p>
                  <p>But ſurely <hi>England</hi> had now well thriven in knowledge, eſpecially from the after Lights to <hi>Luther;</hi> who following his ſteps went further in the knowledge of the Goſpel; truth is, <hi>Luther</hi> oppoſed them, and had his followers; but the other and more, and the opinions increaſed and ſpread further. And to declare the truth, and honor it with reſpect enough to <hi>Luther,</hi> who deſerved much of Gods people, as an inſtrument he had raiſed up for their benefit; his bitterneſs againſt his brethren, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors from the errors of <hi>Rome,</hi> as from what they accounted his miſtake, gave the Papiſts much advantage to upbraid the diſſentions of the Schiſmaticks, ſo called, urging that there was never like to be peace where this gap was opened, that the diviſions of the Church were ſubject to the queſtions or judgements of particular Chriſtians; for from hence each man as his underſtanding or ability was, leſs or more, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as he liſted, and trouble the peace of the Church as theſe Schiſmaticks had done; to prevent which in <hi>England,</hi> it having had ſome footing as was conceived here, through the intereſt of <hi>Henry,</hi> and the youth of <hi>Edward,</hi> who though begot by a Popiſh Father, was educated by a Schiſmatick Tutor: The Biſhops ply it hard by fire and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105181:27"/> faggot, to root out all that followed the way as it was called; they had many nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names in all Ages; but here they who were the Lords Wheat, had the name from the envious man, of the devils Tares caſt upon them, <hi>Lollards;</hi> and they had as in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, all evils, errors, and ſins charged upon them; they were generally poor, and happily the rich thought any way a good riddance, eſpecially being ſo, at leaſt accounted, of proud minds, though in beggars rags, and had all thoſe phraſes of Scripture applied to them as to thoſe who ſubverted ſouls.</p>
                  <p>So that here was a great perſecution, many hundreds were put to death, in oppoſition to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but the State in policy medled not with the taking away of the Abby-Lands, becauſe of the ſtrong party that might have engaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; and they who hoped to have time to make all ſure, would not ſeek that with too much haſte and danger, which by former experience they ſaw a ſmall time would of it ſelf reſtore; for it was taken before, and would ſhortly be again; and hinting never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs that a mite of Gods ſtock, or of the Churches and Church-mens dues, as they called them, in a Lay-mans hands, would bring a moth and curſe upon all his eſtate; ſo that what Covetize had robbed, Conſcience would reſtore, if not double; and as the Church-mens policy was great, ſo they forgot not to foreſee a ſtorm, in caſe <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould depart without iſſue, and the Crown come to <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was, as the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> called them, a Proteſtant, as the <hi>French,</hi> a <hi>Huguenot,</hi> or of the Religion, as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> a Lollard, a Bibler, a Goſpeller; wherefore there were many plots to take her away; before ſhe came to the Crown it was leſs danger; but the Lord prevented, and ſhe truſted in God; having no forces, no armor, no money, all the Realm Papiſts in profeſſion, but a day or two before, <hi>Mary</hi> dead, is with an univerſal joy, almoſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to the Throne; and although the Pope being now ſtrengthened by the decrees of that famouſly infamous Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> had raiſed up all the Princes, ſo called Chriſtian, as much as in him laid, againſt her; and having excommunicated her as an Heretick, gave away the Kingdom to the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> who with a ſo called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible <hi>Armado,</hi> came to conquer it, upon pretence of his holy Father the Popes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and had by Jeſuits, Prieſts, and others laboured many ways to take away her life, yet ſhe out-lived all; and all undertakers againſt her, both in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> brought to themſelves ruine, death, loſs, or ſhame; This in care for the Queen, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Acts of Parliament of ſeveral natures, againſt Papiſts, Prieſts, Seminaries and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, diſtinguiſhing between a Papiſt in opinion, and a Papiſt in faction; and ſo Prieſts, as being the inciters to things abſolutely evil in themſelves, upon Tenents or grounds, not onely unwarrantable in the word, nay abſolutely contrary, but deſtructive to the principles of Nature, humane contracts, as no faith to be kept with Hereticks, no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to kill a Prince, declared heretical by the Pope, and excommunicated: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Prieſt and Papiſts did retort upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Profeſſers, their former pleas for liberty of conſcience in matters of Religion, and upon that account would have ſaved many Traytors to the State of <hi>England;</hi> yet <hi>England</hi> wiſely diſtinguiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe who had ſucked the poyſon, but poyſoned not others; executing theſe, and baniſhing them; yea, though venting their falſe opinions, if not guilty in, or of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of Acts of Treaſon. The Pope ſtomacks this; and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> having now framed a new Church Liturgy, or Book of Common prayers, or rather corrected the old Popiſh Maſs-Book, wherein was nothing contained which the then compilers ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſmell, or have a touch or ſavor of Popery, and caſting out all Q. <hi>Maries</hi> Prieſts, had placed (Proteſtants ſo called) Biſhops and Miniſters in the ſeveral Dioceſſes of the Kingdom, and reſpective Pariſhes; and commanded no other Liturgie to be uſed under ſeveral penalties; the Pope, I ſay, he thereupon inhibits all Papiſts to joyn in the Church duties, offices, or ſervices, with the (now ſo called) Church of <hi>England;</hi> whereupon many refuſe to go to Church, who thereupon were called Recuſants; and although there were great penalties at laſt laid upon them, as of twenty pound a moneth; yet the Recuſants in all Counties were many, eſpecially of the Nobility and Gentry; the vulgar generally, as being bred up under that notion, that ignorance was the mother of Devotion, turned with the Tide, and the change was even to reaſon vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; for the Service being now in <hi>Engliſh</hi> was underſtood, or might be; yet all the Proteſtants were not contented; but ſome apprehended a clearer and more uninte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted light to Reformation for they pretended neither to Biſhopricks nor Deanaries, nor any other ſpiritual promotion, ſo called; no places, either of honor, or profit, but

                  <p>For they declare that the <hi>Romane</hi> apoſtacy was Babyloniſh, and that there was no more commixture to be had with her then with Idols; that all the miniſtry of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, having no other calling then the outward, from Romiſh Preiſts, by the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands, was Antichriſtian; that all the Courts ſo called Ecleſiaſtical, were unlawful, and any Liturgy or ſet form of prayer commanded in the Church, was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious; that indeed Chriſts Kingdom, which was of the Goſpel, would not admit of thoſe prophane mixtures, which the pariſhes in England abounded withal; and that truly none was fit to be a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, who was not fit to be a Church Member; but with all outward acknowledgments of Loyalty to their Prince, as aiming at no turbulency in the State, but modeſtly to offer their opinions to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and it ſeems ſome of theſe opinioniſts, were gotten into the Parliament, if not one into the chaire, whoſe zeal would not admit him to take in conſideration, the Meſſage of the Queen, or affaires of State, till prayers had been made publikely by the Members for a bleſſing from God, and agreed (as <hi>per</hi> one Author) a day to ſeek God by faſting and humiliation, with prayer, upon the whole work; But all theſe were nipt in the bud by the Queens authority, who inlarged prerogative much, through the ardent affection wherewith her vertues had enchained the hearts of her Subjects to her; for ſhe, being enformed by ſome, how highly theſe things might in future times be ſtretched, to the enhanſing the power of the commonalty in Parliament, it being neceſſary to keep them in due bounds; though the Queen might not miſlike the Acts, ſhe did the manner, being done of their own heads, without acquainting her; and although upon the Remonſtrance of divers of theſe non-conformiſts, the Commons again began to ſtir: yet ſhe not only as we may ſay wiſely moderated them, but truſting to the popular affection ſhe had gained, and I hope having no end of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing prerogative to a fatall eminency, ſhe politiquely overſwayed, impriſoning by her own authority, a Member of Parliament for a motion in the houſe, and did, unleſs my Author be deceived, tye the houſe to agitate no buſineſs, but what they received in charge from her; and the Miniſters who pleaded for ſuch a rough thorough reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were not only ſilenced by diſlikes, but by a new impoured high commiſſion, pretended againſt Recuſants, were over-awed, ſo that they were forced to leave the Land; ſome who ſtaid (as the event gave evidence) too indiſcreetly taxed the Queen and her counſel of State of Apoſtacy, lukewarmneſs, nay abſolute Tyranny; it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident truth, that the Queen went no further in reformation then needs ſhe muſt; and truly the Spirits of moſt men would have ſunk under the burthen of her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, and had not God wonderfully preſerved her, ſhe had periſhed an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred waies; ſhe thought not fit therefore to ſtir all at once, ſhe was troubled with ſome riſings every moment; and to have attempted ſuch a work as theſe men preached up, it was not only attended with difficulty and danger, but was accounted tending to Anarchy and ſedition, which was ſo earneſtly laid to their charge, that ſome of theſe ſuffered as Traytors, and the Laws were as, if not more, ſpitefully uſed againſt theſe, ſo called Brownniſts, or Sectaries, then againſt the Papiſts; they were few in Number, but generally the cheif for zeal and knowledge among the common people, who inſtigated the final and total caſheering of the Pope; It is obſervable many Papiſts were found Traitors and abettors of Treaſons againſt the Queen, but not one of theſe, nay they died in her quarrel; they taught, as it was objected, Treaſon, but practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed nought but prayers and patience, yet even theſe ſuffered as the reſt, and therefore being over-burthened in ſpirit, they retired out of the kingdom into <hi>Holland</hi> that is the united Provinces, whence they diſperſed the books of their opinions all over the kingdom, whereby many were (as it was called) poyſoned and corrupted, and now they handled freely all the controverſies wherein they diſſented, being under no laſh, and ſhewed the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> in their Lordly power, the Clergy in their lazy ſet ſervices, and the people in their prophane mixtures to be no better then a mockſhew of Chriſtianity; that all their pretences of Chriſtianity was but formal, their learning in the Scriptures was but natural, Sermons rather rethorical flouriſhes then Soul-ſaving doctrine; and indeed the lives of theſe profeſſors were worſe generally then heathens,

God bleſſed her infinitely and her people; riches with trading increaſed greatly, and the hate of <hi>Spaine</hi> had made her potent at Sea; ſhe was great relief to the diſtreſſed <hi>Hollander,</hi> and a ſanctuary of ſafety to the Poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant through Popiſh cruelty no longer able to live in <hi>France;</hi> and truly if reports be true, her Court was that of the beſt nurture among all the Princes (ſo called) Chriſtian; and though her ſucceſſor <hi>James</hi> were a wiſe Prince, and well ſeen in all the controverſies of religion for a King, yet he made little alteration, he loved not Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, but he durſt not hate them: he would not promote them, nor exaſperate them; and in his latter daies he grew too flexible towards Papiſts, and offered indulgent Articles upon the treaty of a marriage with <hi>Spain,</hi> which he much hoped and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for as was thought, being tired with their continual practiſes againſt him; others believed thereby to ſtrengthen himſelf againſt the Puritan party, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all Court policies and Law devices did increaſe in all Counties: and ſome did dare from forraign parts to tell their mindes to him plainly, while others at home did in Parliament with a little boldneſs ſtand upon the priviledges of their houſe; So that King <hi>James</hi> thought it not ſafe to call them too often; But under pretence of remedying what was amiſs, or defective in the Law, he lifted high the Courts of Star-Chamber, Wards and Requeſts, but eſpecially the Councel Table; And that he might not ſtand in need of money if poſſible, aliened many of the Crown lands, and looſing the good Laws concerning apparel altogether, opened the door to exceſſive vanity in apparel, which yet inhanſed cuſtomes, ſo that I have heard what was thirty thouſand pounds at higheſt in the daies of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was at the loweſt two hundred thouſand pounds in the daies of <hi>James;</hi> He was a wiſe Prince and of

Yet while no man can force a reſolved man, who can force a King? and the laſt and great Act being his, the whole was adjudged to him (yet not alone.) An other Act of great judgement to his end was the conſtant uſe of proclamations declarative not only of the Law, but his pleaſure, in other lands called Edicts, or Acts of the King alone, or his ſaying or will reſolved into Law; theſe were at firſt put out upon things benificial for the Subject, and were as it were a temporary Law of exigency or proviſion by the King for what the Law was either being antiquated, and now revived, or els that for which there was no Law in the caſe, yet neceſſary to be provided for, and ſo was a time of Tryal or an Act of probation againſt the next Parliament. And theſe powers were never denyed Kings formerly, or but ſeldome, being but ſeldome uſed and generally upon good grounds, ſo that no diſobedience followed; but at laſt his proclamations were divers of them though carrying a colour of Law ſlighted; But he being of a very quiet ſpirit could not enter a conteſt, but ſought to work his end an other way, and that was to call Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments: And to create new Honors, and ſo over-vote and conſequently over-power the Parliament, debaſing Spirits by dependance; and this having a ſtrong influence upon the Gentry, dulled now with long peace (a natural politique of this Prince, and not the leaſt conducing to his end if he could or would have known when to have taken up the ſword) as he ſuppoſed they would; for they were generally ſo beſotted of theſe Court bables of honor, that upon his or a great mans letter, who their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips pleaſed, was made a Parliament man; and the Houſe of Lords and Commons the Bar or Clyff againſt the Torrent of Tyranny, was become an inlet to that Ocean; but there was one great jealoſie ſtill which was a bar, and this was the Kings exceſſive prodigality to his own Nation, who were as greedy to aske as he to give, ſo that the Engliſh grew a little, I may ſay a great deale, diſcontented, eſpecially the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſort.

                  <p>But theſe men believed that as this was indeed aimed at, and this aime publikely allowed, ſo that there was an other intention which lay hid, and undiſcovered; and that was to force <hi>Scotland</hi> in caſe of oppoſition by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Armes, and to provoke each other to theſe ſeveral works by a ſhort kind of policy; the <hi>Scot</hi> was engaged ſo as he muſt yeild what was his chiefeſt glory; And if he yeilded not, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus diſrelliſhed, would be quick to the quarrel; This I ſay not to be the Kings aime. No, I believe he might ſee no more then the plain ſurface matter, and never be able to diſcover either this intended by ſome, or that other politique which I now relate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105181:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> by others, who yet drove on the ſame deſign; but as ſuppoſing, that it was a certain way to involve the two Nations in a War, which their conditions required; but his reſolution was to keep all quiet; and truly knowing of the Scotch temper, he urged, but inforced not; commanded, but compelled not; and though he better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved <hi>Englands</hi> Hierarchical order, he would not utterly reject the rigidity of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbytery, though he had found ſome croſs dealings at their hands, which in <hi>England</hi> would have been called the ſcandal of the Crown, and were not altogether ſavouring of a Chriſtian modeſty and humility; were it but for the Kirk to command a Faſt on that day the King had appointed a ſolemn Feaſt of State, and that after the Feaſt was publikely known and divulged.</p>
                  <p>I mention but a peccadillo, and that under a ſuppoſition, becauſe I would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that to things, which may be, was, and will be only the errour of perſons, during the reign of theſe two princes <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> notwithſtanding the many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the exceſs and defects of the Laws in their ſeveral reſpects; yet nothing was done truly worthy the ſupream powers by them claimed; there were ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtreams or rivulets of errour amended, or at leaſt pretended by particular Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, both in giving Laws where none were, and amending what was amiſs; but out alas, the Ocean whence all theſe had their riſe, was ſtill the ſame: Three ſpecial Statutes I muſt here remember of <hi>James;</hi> one to puniſh with death him or her that had two wives, or two husbands, but not made death to commit Adultery; yet as I have heard canvaſſed at the ſame Parliament, this Statute ſeverely executed: The ſecond as rigidly, which was concerning them that were or are delivered of Baſtards, pretended dead born, and having no witneſs preſent, to be taken as murderers: The laſt was, the regulating of the number of Attornies for good cauſe there ſpecified, which never was ſo much as in the leaſt obſerved, nor a Judge ever queſtioned for it; yet this as to the world, and in carnall reſpects, of as neceſſary concernment as the other.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not progreſs further here concerning ought, being now come to the portall of the Theater of all Quaeries in the multitude of queſtions ſtirred up in the Raign of King <hi>Charles,</hi> who ſucceeding his father with all the expectations that might be of the vulgar, his entertainment to the Crown was with all congratulations of a high joy, ſuch as the high condition of his eſtate required, in a ſetled Kingdome, having enjoyed a continued peace for almoſt 140. years, whereby riches abounded exceedingly; but with them pride increaſed, ſo that ſpirits grown high, they were ready to kick at the prick; and the rather, in reſpect knowledge abounded, and they were not ignorant of their own ſtrength: And what the Romaniſts foreſaw, was now held high time to provide for; for whether it were the advice of King <hi>James,</hi> or the diſpoſition of <hi>Charls,</hi> or the natural jealouſie of Kings, or the ſupream over-ruling decree, intending by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to fit things to the determinate end, I here diſcuſs not; but this bright day was ſoon ore-caſt; for in the firſt Parliament, which I ſuppoſe, was called in or about the third year of this King, after ſome order taken for the regulation of evils againſt the civil peace, and ſome kind of care taken for puniſhing the great prophaners of the Lords Day; the King not well liking the Petition ſo called of Right, being indeed a ſtrong limit to dreaded Prerogative, yet grants it, and continues the Parliament, untill he had obtained ſeven Subſidies of the people diſtinct, and eight from the ſo called Clergy, and then diſſolves it: But there was another ſpecial reaſon, namely, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were grown exceeding high and fierce againſt not only the ſpecial Favourite of the King, the then Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> but ſecretly taxing the King himſelf, as at leaſt an Abettor to him, in the too ſoon ſpeeding his Father out of this world. I beleeve it is evident to moſt that the Duke committed a crime, &amp; notorious to all, that the King did by diſſolving this Parliament, hinder the tryal of him; but this doth not evidence his guilt, though it gives matter of ſurmize; but this may be handled fitlier otherwhere, if need requires. The breach of this Parliament gave a great diſguſt to the people; the rather, becauſe it plainly appeared, the King wholly, and almoſt only ſought himſelf; for although he had acknowledged by Act, the neceſſity of continuing the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſettle fit remedies for many notorious grievances, yet before ought expedited but his own buſineſs, (as it was juſtly called) of the Subſidies, He, of his ſo called Royal will, annihilates all by nullifying the Parliament, as he was ſaid to do; and indeed, it amounted not to much leſs; for he did at leaſt, by his inſtruments which he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105181:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> owned, almoſt with the ſame breath he aſſented to the ſo called Petition of Right, or due Rights of the Subject, break it, and proceeded ſo far to aggrandize the power of the Prince, that he made the Subject a ſlave, having a ſpeaker fit for his ends, a man of as mercinary a ſpirit as could be; for upon ſome incivility, as it was called, of ſome mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers zealous for Reformation, who loth to have the Parliament ſo fruitleſly diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, held the Speaker in his Chayre, to Vote a Remonſtrance to the King, he impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons them, ſeizes their Trunks, ſearches their, not only chambers, but pockets, moſt of which dyed in reſtraint, being accompted the Martyrs of the peoples Liberties, whom the King thought the greateſt means of ſubverting of them, as intending ſtill to drive on the conteſt betwixt the King and his people, which was begun in <hi>William</hi> ſo called the Conqueror; and ſurely he could not but eſpy, that notwithſtanding all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to the contrary, the people had ſtill gained upon the Crown; and ſurely what he expreſſed in full Parliament, and which is printed among the Statutes at large, more then cleared his jealouſies of encroachments upon him, which is a ſufficient cauſe to a Prince to ſtretch his power; and ſurely was, as before is ſaid in part, with thoſe other reaſons annexed, not only the cauſe of that Seſſions prorogation, the then Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments diſſolution, or rather by not keeping his ſo called Kingly word, annihilation; but the not calling of Parliaments till neceſſity enforced, as if he had ſeen, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen the fate which hath ſince enſued. I cannot beleeve him ignorant of all thoſe, not onely ſo called propheſies, but of thoſe conjecturall obſervations of thoſe grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians, ſo called, which how his wiſdom might prevail over, I know not; but aſſuredly, Princes of all are moſt eaſie and ſubject to be entrapped, at leaſt the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive part of them; neither ſhall I here treat of the power of the Stars, if at all, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I muſt profeſs, little have hapned in the notorious part of his Reign, which ſuch Artiſts did not more or leſs foretell: But becauſe out of his Reign, is, as it were, raiſed the fountain of all controverſies, both divine and humane, let us ſhortly run over the ſtate of the ſo called Church and Commonwealth, and begin with the Church, which though not ſo furniſhed with large Territories, nor multitudes of Religious, ſo called, Profeſſors, as before thoſe neſts of Monaſteries, Nunneries, Fryeries, Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, Colledges, &amp;c. being diſſolved and confiſcated; yet to the remaining Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Provoſts, Deanes, Deanes and Chapters, Vicars, Vicars Charols, Chaunteries, Cathedrals, ſub-Deanes, Arch-Deacons, &amp;c. (pardon that ſhort enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of many glorious beaſts of Babels foreſt) there was a ſufficient maintenance, to perform the duties required in a Biſhop by <hi>Paul,</hi> without any by-encroachment; but theſe men were now grown civil Lords, and having contracted Marriage with the world, they lay with it, and neglected their duty to their Lord and husband, the Lord Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>They had large Palaces of old Babel, the ſame ſeats in their ſeveral Provinces called Dioceſs, the ſame ſtructures or great Churches, the ſame Attendants, (for their Courts Juridical were not taken away) theſe all required maintenance, and that by reaſon of worldly pomp in great meaſure; but they had enough for this, had not the itch of the fleſh brought them as other men to avoid fornication, to betake them to their own wives; and the ſame carnal prudence which before prohibited Marriage, leſt the care of the world, and love of children, &amp;c. ſhould cauſe imbeſelling the Churches, ſo called, Revenue; the ſame now wrought unjuſt ſeekings of gain by any means, to the prejudice of the Church. Before the ſtorm in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eights time, many long Leaſes were made, before Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> many more; ſo that to aſſure mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhe was enforced (the Father of the Church for fleſhly children ſakes, robbing and waſting their ſpiritual Mother) to that prudential Law, that they, &amp;c. could make no new Leaſes, or renew any old, but for three lives, or 21. years, reſerving the old rent; but as children increaſed and worldly temptations, theſe Church men could ſo far diſpenſe, as either to coyn old, or elſe new Leaſes, with this bleſsing from the rule in Law, <hi>Valet quantum valere poteſt,</hi> and theſe were to their children, ſervants, friends, or the beſt friend a good fine; they had alſo alwayes grants of Leaſes to ſuch, and new concurrent Leaſes: Thus were they made poor, who were rich, by ſtealing each from other; and their firſt fruits which was the firſt years revenue, was now paid to their Lord the King, as before to the Pope; their dependance by the Statute of Supremacy, ſuffering that alteration; this made them look to all profits narrowly; And what could be caught, was; Ordination bought at the worſt hand, Marriage at a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105181:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſet rate, and the uſual publike Declarations, ſo called, bidding the bands of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, brought to a ſcorn; all that could purchaſe it had a Licence; and the Wills and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men being canvaſed in every Arch-Deaconry, Dioceſs, and Province, brought a ſetled gain. Batchelors of the Civil Law capable of two Benefices, or Spiritual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, and ſo the Chaplains of the King, Noblemen, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And this Apoſtate order was univerſal: Again, the Biſhops now made injunctions, ſome one, ſome another at their own wil; and the breach of all, or any of theſe, was cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizable in any their Courts, from the Chancellors to the High Commiſsion (ſo called, indeed a pretty <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition) yea ſo far as to puniſh the not-wearing of a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice at the reading the Liturgie, or ſo called Common Prayers, or ſet and publike appointed prayers in the Church, with impriſonment during pleaſure, fine of 1000. l. when a Blaſphemer, for ſpeaking theſe dreadful words to the eares of any but an Atheiſt (he being admoniſhed for ſwearing, ſaid) I will ſwear God out of Heaven, and ſit there as God my ſelf, was fined but 100. l. and mitigation of impriſonment. I do atteſt this my ſelf, being preſent at the ſentence of this Blaſphemer, and at the Sentence of Doctor <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> for writing againſt Epiſcopacy; and <hi>Burdet</hi> of <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> (for non conformity) the ſame time, who had in that word two offences, one not wearing the Surplice, the other the Churching (ſo called, that is, declaring) a woman purified according to the Levitical Law, after child-bearing, without a Vayle or Rayle which was the injunction of the Biſhop. And now the Queen being Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, that is, Romane, the Liberty of the Maſs grew from the Queens private houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, to a moſt frequent houſhold duty, and at leaſt was publique, yet not with any toleration, that is, if toleration be taken for a legall Act authorizing; but if for an impunity, notwithſtanding many and oft complaints, there was a grand toleration; and the Judges had by ſpecial order from his Majeſty, command againſt them, under the name of Recuſants; but with this hint, that there was a more dangerous Recuſant, called the Puritan or Browniſt; for then there was no diſtinction; ſo that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops armed with the power of the Civil Magiſtrate, under the late ſchiſmaticall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo termed at <hi>Rome,</hi> of his having both the Keyes, that is, being the ſupream ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vulgar acceptaion, both in Civil and Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſtrict notion, having the ſupream intendency, not only over, but in the Church, which the Puritan urged with ſo much warineſs, abſolutely holding the Lord Chriſt the ſupream, and yet craving the Majeſterial power, to ayde and aſsiſt with the name of ſupremacy, ſo far as ran even with his opinion; that it was doubted he was as ill a willer to the abſolute Juriſdiction of the Prince in the Church, as the Papiſt was; ſo that he was exploded the Court, and no allowance given to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine there; and indeed with all poſsible vexations of the Lawes, by impriſoning, fining, attending, delaying, ſtigmatizing, &amp;c. all that were ſo called were handled by the Biſhops, and the ſo called Clergy, with their Officers; no marvel; for theſe men, generally Lay men, preached in their writings more and more edifying Doctrine, then the Clergy in their Pulpits; and theſe mens lives and labours were as exemplary for godlineſs, as the other for vanity, pride, lazineſs, and debauchedneſs; yet theſe (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they were conformable, that is, obedient to the Fathers of the Church, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, be it right or wrong) were freely almoſt only allowed; for money now could do all things, and neceſsity more; there was on the one ſide Symony upon Symony, yea much legall Symony, for the great rich Livings; and whether the Prieſt could preach or not, his Curate could, and where the Impropriator had a large revenue, the poor Curate not above 10. l. <hi>per annum,</hi> and 20. l. a large ſtipend, he muſt be of weak parts, that would ſo reſt contented, and ſeek no other preferment; this brought in together with ſo many Pariſhes as bad as impropriate, being in the gift of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Churches, where Biſhops or Dean and Chapters had the gifts, ſo many ignorant, lazy, debauched fellows into the Miniſtry, that a Chriſtian would ſtand amazed: And when ſome pious men ſought a way to purchaſe out theſe impropriations, and to ſettle an able religious preaching Miniſtry, they were allowed to expend their monies, which I beleeve they never ſaw penny of again, but were ſo frowned upon and diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, that the beginners being wearied, the work even dyed in the firſt Cradle; for theſe things made the Biſhops plot for life, and as plain as words could manifeſt the intentions of men, it was reſolved, No Reformer, as they now begin to call them, ſhould ſtay in <hi>England;</hi> and indeed their troubles grew ſo faſt upon them, that they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105181:30"/> were forced for fear of being taken at a good and Chriſtian duty and puniſhed by the Law of Liveries now called Conventicles, to pack away, ſome to <hi>Holland,</hi> ſome to <hi>America,</hi> (or new <hi>England</hi> ſo called,) being a gallant plantation, ſome to other places. The Biſhops Chaplaines become ſole maſters of the preſs, and their licences were as bad as an <hi>Index expurgatorius;</hi> Popiſh books are now ſeverely forbidden, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thoſe quant Tracts of <hi>Cauſſinus,</hi> yet almoſt in every mans hand, as if they had been forbidden only to quicken ſale, an old yet notable Trick; The Arch-Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops book being a Tract written againſt <hi>Fiſher</hi> the Jeſuite, is printed; but at the ſame time all the great wits blow up the Quodliberts of Popery, the chief heads being publiquely and profeſſedly maintained at both the ſo called Univerſities; And a Jeſuite (ſo called) <hi>Franciſcus de ſancta Clara,</hi> brings both the Papiſt and the Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to ſo neer an Union, that a good judgement might be decieved (tis probable, for many were) to know the one from the other. Many ſo called <hi>Arminians</hi> now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; theſe are highly favoured everywhere; and now the Hierachy ſo lifts up it ſelf, that not the Gentry only, but even the Nobility themſelves were diſcountenanced, if oppoſing; All preferments are now to theſe, yet few of them knew well how to bear them, but a litle time could give them a reliſh, and the ſmack would never out of their fancies. The opinions of the Romaniſts now on all ſides, not only for hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places, or ſacring them, but even that one place of or among theſe ſo called ſacred, was more holy then other, from the duty there performed, or otherways: adorning Churches, the ſeveral Manners, Places, Times of bowing, geſture, and order of pronunciation, at or in reading, all not only diſcourſed of, but applauded, and generally practized; adoration at the entery of the Church, and alſo at depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that to the Eaſt, all for uniformity, the great and ſpecial pretence of the ſo called Church, that is the Biſhops, the Fathers of the Church, according to their own ſtile: Bowing or Genuflexion or Adorations to at or of the name of Jeſus, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream unction, Confirmation, Pennance, all practiſed; yea a Nuntio of the Pope, but not ſo owned, yet well known, and which troubled the people moſt of all, a raile of wood or other partition betwixt the ſo called Prieſt and people at the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament ſo called of the Altar, and this of neceſſity: and the words of adminiſtration purely Popiſh (as yet in the directory.) But all perſons without queſtion in the pariſh admitted to the Sacrament as by Law was eſtabliſhed; theſe things ſetled, they haſte for power to the further ſetlement of the Church in power and purity; and by the Kings power they are convened, and called the ſacred Synod, where they Act with large commiſſion, and fearing counter-buffs of Providence by them called Fortune, they denied the Pope, but admitt Popery in its full height; and to evidence the Antichriſtianiſme, they eſtabliſh their Hierarchy with an oath, with that famous clauſe of <hi>&amp;c.</hi> labouring as the brood of old <hi>Rome,</hi> to bring all Temporal juriſdiction under eccleſiaſtick cenſure; and this was the condition of the Church or Churchmen, or Clergy men ſo called.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now as ſhortly give you a veiw of the civill State, as the neceſſity of perſpicuity will well permit. You have heard upon what a politique Baſis <hi>William</hi> ſo called the Conqueror, founded his Empire, which yet from evident cauſes declining even in the ſpace of his own and Sons Raign, did evidently ſhew the frailty of all humane wiſdome, and therefore might well in the ſpace of ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years be brought to nothing; and truly once for all to ſay it, I am in my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence perſwaded that King <hi>Charles</hi> did ſee the want of Law in this land to govern the Nation rightly, and upon that foundation ſought to mould the kingdom to the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of other Nations; for it is a ſure and certain principle that States grow old and Laws &amp;c. And if not reduced by reformation, there is a neceſſity of a new formation. Now the chief thing which a Prince looketh at, is the power of War or the Sword; and this ſo far as the power reſted in the King, which was his Tenure, was clean loſt, and gone; for the many tranſmutations of poſſeſſions, had made many litigious queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, partly through the corruption of officers, not duly awarding proceſs againſt alienators without licenſe, partly other defects of certain boundaries, and partly the evill of time, which had through divers diſcents parcelled great eſtates into many perſons; So that there were many Tenants, but few Knights; and what was at firſt an honor, to hold of the King or by Knights ſervice, becauſe the Tenants Son and Heire ſhould yet come to the education of a Lord paramount or higher then the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105181:31"/> Father, and ſo ſhould be bettered both for Arts and Arms; the Kings of late years had made them abſolutely but the fees of their Servants, and the Heirs of gallant men were as bad as ſlaves to the will of the Kings Grantee: whereby they were yoaked unequally in marriage, or their eſtates were generally ſqueiſed of ſometime a third, ſometimes a fourth, or fifth part in the Court of Wards; ſo that they that ſhould have been the Princes guard as it were, being thus prejudiced in their minority, and drinking in haſtily the complaints of their friends, bewailing their Wardſhips as an inſufferable vaſſalage, could not heartily ſeek to maintain that power whoſe ſubſiſtence was their ruine to eternity in all their progeny; and through the long tract of time it was grown to this, that almoſt any great or rich mens Son muſt be a Ward; all Titles of Lands being ſo exceedingly intricated, that it was almoſt impoſſible to clear it; and this rigor was never higher then in the daies of this King; ſo that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, for a ſetled <hi>Militia</hi> for his own defence he had none, but had left himſelf naked to the ſtrokes of any timely oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>Next, as he had robbed himſelf thus of power, ſo had the example of all the Kings in part, and the power from jealouſie in other part, deveſted the Lords of all power military, by dependencies of Knights ſervice.</p>
                  <p>The Oathes of homage and fealty the Kings had reſpited them to enhanſe a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and the Lords were not willing to urge that which had been ſo fatall to many their predeceſſors, through their dependencies; and being now grown generally looſe, lazy or worſe, from the long peace we had enjoyed, they had no conteſts but at Tennis, Drinking, Dicing, or worſe ſports, and ſometimes a Law ſuite; Theſe yet ſunk many of their eſtates, and they had no waies of raiſing them but by the Kings ſole favour; for there were no Lords now that had abſolute power in any County; this made them wholly quiet; and the rather becauſe to be of an active warlike ſpirit, gave cauſe of jealouſie to a Prince; eſpecially of any who were not meerly his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (namely, of ancient popular Nobility, that is their Anceſtors of great repute with the people,) Many therefore retired themſelves, lived privately and quietly, in reſpect of the Court, but few of them with great love in the Countries where they were reſiant, carrying too ſevere a hand towards their Tenants, by racking of Farme-rents, and otherwaies, as Lords of Mannors enhanſing fines, as all the Gentry alſo at their own wills encloſing of Commons for private profit; and by the evill example both of themſelves, Servants and Retainers, bringing a general Lewdneſs, Looſeneſs, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d debauchery in religion and civill manners into all the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>For the Country ſtill (at leaſt as far as it may or can) imitates the Court; and ſo downward; by this means a general almoſt univerſal pravity and corruption ſtole upon, and got poſſeſſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; not that I think (to ſpeak once for all) that <hi>England</hi> was worſe in any reſpect eirher for civill or Eccleſiaſtick govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then any other Chriſtian kingdom; no, but that it had departed from that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Government which it ſelf held forth, and had in ſome meaſure exerciſed, yet was then taxed to hold forth little of a true Chriſtian Government at all; for firſt, though the Sabboth was held moral, yet it was prophaned, and that by publique authority, as by the book of ſports, which alſo gave ſuch a looſe to the power of the maſter of the family, that he could not govern by an exact rule, that power being before too much broken, and this opened a gap to all inordinate walking towards magiſtracy in other both ſuperior and inferior places.</p>
                  <p>But aſſuredly the foundation of this miſchief was principally in the abuſed practiſe of the Courts of Juſtice of this kingdom; which holding alſo a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> dependency as before was hinted, there was no ſtint of ſtrife; for the Law admitted appeals, and what was ſo called the Subjects due, ought not be denied them; ſo that if you had either a knaviſh or a powerfull adverſary to deal withal (which power is manifold, as either a great rich man, or greatly friended by the officers, or els powerful in a joynt ſtock, as a corporation, whoſe united purſes have ruled over all juſtice and righteouſneſs whatſoever in many places) you could not get right but with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that is looſing by the bargain; the particulars I ſhall demonſtrate after; this ruined many, diſcouraged more, diſcontented all, (except the gainers, which were and are ſuch a rabble and bed-roul of names in both Laws, as would amaze a wiſe man, much more a Chriſtian;) for whereas a Chriſtian ſaith, let all things among
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105181:31"/> you be done in love, and let the brethren judge your differences; that is without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigious pleadings after the manner of the world, but with that quietneſs, gentleneſs, meekneſs, and botherlike affection, as the Goſpel of Chriſt holds forth; and the prudent man ſaith, let it be before wiſe men, duly appointed, in a time convenient, and with certainty; and what one Judge cannot determine, either for difficulty, or doubting, let aid be joyned and right done, and that whither according to the exact letter, or the rule of conſcience.</p>
                  <p>The Laws of <hi>England</hi> held forth all things in practice; I ſay in practice (for the general rules or foundations of <hi>Englands</hi> Laws are good, wholſome and ſanative) ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely contrary; for it held forth in the letter you ſhould have right for every wrong; this general rule was good, but diſcend to the particular;</p>
                  <p>The Quaere now is what remedy for the wrong; an Action you muſt proſecute; But firſt it is conſiderable by whom this Action ſhall be brought; for long ſuites and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive have bin had: and then the party ought either to have one or more joyned with them; or where the Action was ioynt, it ought to have bin ſole, ſometimes in the reſpect of the nature of the Action, ſometimes in reſpect of the way of aſſeſſing or recovery of damages; next it is conſiderable in what Court; for ofttimes 100. <hi>li.</hi> hath been ſpent in the Court, and then the Court had no cognizance of the buſineſs, yet the ableſt Lawyers in <hi>England</hi> adviſed within the caſe or ſo accounted as moſt favored &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But grant you hit the Court; then the Quaere is what Action; for one hundred Actions have been proſecuted in the right Court, and before right and due Judges, and by the right perſon, and then the Action miſtaken, it was deceit, and ſhould have been a Treſpaſs; or a Teſpaſs where it ſhould have bin deceit; ſo almoſt in all matters of higher or lower nature; next agreeing what Action, where ſhall you begin your ſuite? out of what Court have your proceſs? and for your proceſs, whither from above, that is the Kings bench which now holds cognizance of all pleas, or the Common pleas the proper Court of all Subjects differences betwixt themſelves; at leaſt in the Common Pleas by original, in the Common bench by Latitat, or els in the Chequer by a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that you are a Debtor to the King, or below in the County or City, if the ſum be not above their Trial; and for the Chancery and ſuch other Courts a Subpaena; and then the ſeveral Writs muſt be iſſued in due courſe, or all is nought. Next for the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Writ, there is for the Chancery &amp;c. either the party plaintife or ſome other ſhows the writ to the Defendant, or leaves a part, or the body of it ſo called as the caſe requires, at his houſe, and if he appears not, proceſs iſſues againſt his perſon; but upon the other, he muſt be arreſted by a Serjeant (of the Mace ſo called, the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of a City) or a bayliffe, whether common, ſpecial, or of a liberty, there is not much difference, they are much alike. Now theſe mens livelyhood is under the Sheriffe to execute writs of all ſorts; to judgements and Executions they have a fee proper from the party; but that was ſet ſo long ſince, that it is not a ſufficient maintenance now; and rather then take paines to raiſe that, well foreſeeing the trouble it would bring, to alter all Fees in the Nation, they let them gripe the poor, and abuse the rich, and wrong all; Yea aſſuredly they many of them take hire of the Debitor or Treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer not to ſee him, and of the Plaintiffe or Creditor to ſee him; as the ſearchers or under-writers for cuſtomes formerly, or now for exciſe may do, either for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited or cuſtome ſtoln goods; So that ofttime the charge of arreſting, is as much as the Debt, and it is generally known that theſe men are the worſt ſort of men; the old Law was, none to be arreſted but to find ſureties that his cauſe was juſt, and that he would proſecute with effect; but that juſt Law being too hard to many poor men, to ſurmiſe the beſt, was not remedied, but by practiſe (that is the unwarantable proceedings of Judges) Totally aboliſhed; and now a bill of Middleſex may abuſe any man unknown, and the law is made a ſtale to the both foolery and knavery of Sycophants or worſe; there is much pleaded for this arreſting by Bayliffs; as firſt he is a known and ſworn officer; I ſay only if he be ſo, let his Summons without a Writ or attaching the perſon be enough; and if twice ſummoned, let him be proceeded againſt as to his goods, who will not appear, provided he be at or in Town; but this is beyond my taske intended here.</p>
                  <p>There is another way of making the offender appear, which is by Utlagary, uſed very unjuſtly, and ſo confeſſed but as good as the reſt. The next thing is where I muſt lay my action; that is, in what County. And many times the action is laid in <hi>London</hi> for a matter
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105181:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> of ſo ſmall moment, that a journey to <hi>London</hi> of himſelf, and witneſſes, eats out all the gain juſtice gives, eſpecially when ſmall matters are removed outof the County; juſtly, as I will ſay in this caſe, they being indeed above the now proper rate of County or City Trialls; or elſe unjuſtly, as when a man is arreſted in a liberty for five pound, or forty ſhillings only, which is there triable; he gets himſelf arreſted alſo for a greater ſumm, and ſo removes both to <hi>London:</hi> now for theſe proceedings in abuſe of the common ſubject of the Nation in Law-proceedings, believe not I can, or hope to open all the ſleights, tricks, quillets, fetches, deceits, knaveries and abuſes, with the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious, abominable, prophane juggles thereof, it being in the whole practiſe; I ſay practiſe of it, nothing elſe but vanity and wickedneſs; I am loth to ſay robbery, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, and ſuch like epithites, which ſome mens zeal beſtow upon it, cauteriſed under the ſcourge and laſh of a long, pilling, polling ſuit, hurried from Town to City, from City to Country, from Court to Court, Hearing upon Hearing, Order upon Order, Judgements and Verdicts both ſo called, and yet in a labyrinth, not onely Term after Term, but year after year, and ſtill almoſt as far off as ever, if not further: no, I aim but to give a clear light that our Laws practiſed, are not the Laws of the Nation, that is, a ſet rule of Juſtice, but uſurped upon us by evil men they are, as practiſed neither according to natural reaſon, the foundation of the Laws of Nations, nor Religion the Law of the Almighty Wiſdom; pardon my zealous digreſſion. I now return to what I had omitted; which is, that by Law, that is the cuſtome allowed, A Sheriff, or under-Sheriff ſhall make Returns of Courſe onely for the benefit of Officers; as for example, that the party was not found within his Baylewick; or that he hath no goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when both are contrary; yet he is ſworn to excute all Writs truly; but this is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury by, or within the judgements of any the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Judges, becauſe not being within the niceties of their wiſe ſayings or reſolutions, no more then thouſands of other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, which though they may excuſe themſelves for, becauſe the Laws of the Land, ſo called, look not at them, as the Judges of ſuch perjuries; yet that they get no other Law eſtabliſhed, ſeeing the great want for redreſs of ſuch matters they finde before them, will be their or the Lands afflictions at laſt, but to go on in a courſe of Triall. Theſe difficulties over, I muſt now put in my Declaration, that is, the narration of my complaint into the Court in writing, and that not in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but <hi>Latine,</hi> (though I underſtand never a word) and that in the form the Law requires, (though I can tell no more then the meer matter of my wrong) And in the ſame manner muſt my adverſary, ſo called alſo, though little wiſer then my ſelf: But to help out this, we have Attorneyes, ſo called, allowed Deputies to anſwer for us, skilled in the way of practiſe (and theſe men they do even do what they liſt) for the Client, ſo called, is ſeldom knowing of practiſe; and he hath ſo much firſt for his Fee; then drawing the Declaration or Plea, which is, either general or ſpecial, and though done with much difficulty and charge, is oft miſtaken the one for the other; again double pleas are exploded; and though great advice taken which matter to plead, the beſt is left, and ſo left remedileſs at Law, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a new bout in another Court help him, or elſe the Chancery; either of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies is generally worſe then the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon of Attorneys was this; as riches multiplied, pride and outward pomp encreaſed, long ſuits came into faſhion, and to maintain Officers, it was laboured for to avoid further ſuit, by theſe means to bring all Trials to the upper Bench, or common Pleas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And pleadings ordered wholly in form, and in Latine, which, what for eaſe, and what for (the ſo pretended being ſo made) neceſſity, namely keeping of Records as preſidents they were admitted, and to get an Attorney was difficult in ſuch chargeable proſecutions, which to remedy, they were allowed privil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lient being generally, if not wholly led by the Atturney, they were the principal men; and Lawyers grown numerous, many would covenant to have
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105181:32"/> half Fees with the Councel. I profeſs, and averr, that a late Judge did, being a Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, declare it to me, as an audacious part of <hi>I. B.</hi> whom I then found going from him, with theſe words Paultry ſaucy Knave caſt after him by the Serjeant.</p>
                  <p>But aſſuredly they were grown very knowing in the practical part of the Law; and ſome of them have (among multitudes of more) had theſe abuſive practiſes laid to their charge againſt the Laws, as taking of <hi>Capias's</hi> from the Common-Pleas, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver filing an Original; This redounding meerly to his profit, abuſing the Officers of the Court to inrich himſelf, and not advantage his Client; for the Curſitor, ſo called, looſeth one ſhilling, the Philizer one ſhilling two pence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the Writ which is ſix ſhillings two pence, cometh onely to him, except for the Seal ſeven pence; and if this be diſcovered before Iudgement, though after Verdict, I believe it would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the whole proceeding.</p>
                  <p>So in ſuing forth the <hi>Capias utlag.</hi> For whereas upon true practiſe, a <hi>Capias</hi> being awarded to the Sheriff, who (by wicked cuſtome not looking after him) returns a <hi>Non eſt inventus,</hi> that is, upon a Writ to take his body, the Sheriff, though he might take him, returns him not found; whereupon another <hi>Capias</hi> or Writ to take his body, wherein of Cuſtome, as aforeſaid, the Sheriff again makes ſuch a (perjured in Chriſtian accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) return again; then goes forth another Writ, mentioning what ado they have made to get him; and oft times he is out of the County indeed, it being done of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in another County, that he might not know it; and then for his contumacy, he is exactioned, proclaimed, and out-lawed, and this oft in two Terms, which ought to be done in five by the Law; but little juſtice in any part of it, though ſpetious in pretence; yet if the <hi>Capias</hi> were delivered to the Sheriff, there were ſome rule obſerved; but the knowing Atturneys can do it themſelves, uſing the Sheriffs name, who never ſees the Writ, and did he, not one of a hundred can tell what to do, but by his under-Sheriff, a late conſtituted Officer upon the high made difficulties of Law, who being one of the ſame Tribe, calleth diſcovering of error defiling the neaſt, and ſo lets all paſs as Cuſtome leads: Thus is a man put out by the Law of the priviledge of a Subject, and this only to maintain Officers; for let all the courſe be examined, and the iſſue will be nought elſe. I have known this ſued againſt a man, for that the Law gave no action, the party yet never demanded the thing; and of a man not worth twenty ſhillings in the whole world, and the matter it ſelf not worth five ſhillings, the Charges came to nigh four pound; and if he hath notice, no way but to ſue a <hi>Superſedeas,</hi> which is, I take it, forty ſhillings to the Judge; otherwiſe to the Gaole without mercy; of which Gaoles a word after. Next, this is an ordinary courſe, at leaſt ſo reported, in petty treſpaſſes they declare of courſe, meerly to get Fees upon agreement, though they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign no place; others having liberty to proceed as they ſee good, and make an end, or do any thing, which is generally the courſe of quiet poor people; there is favor promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to either party; he draws a judgement from his adverſary the defendant, yet ſues on ſtill, and brings it down to Trial <hi>Per Niſi prius;</hi> then ſtops proceedings, with ſaying he will confeſs a Judgement, and enters it the Term after; others enter up Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Warrant; (I have known worſe abuſes yet, but no puniſhments) oft for want of entring a Rule they ſuffer Judgement <hi>Per nihil dicit,</hi> whereby great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Charge accrues to the Client, and but ſmall gain to themſelves; but hereby they pleaſure the Officers; oft times they plead or confeſs a <hi>Non ſum informatus,</hi> and this without Warrant, and then comes out a Judgement unexpected; and this dealing is juſtly ſuſpected of falſe dealing.</p>
                  <p>It was ordinary to enter falſe Orders, falſe Affidavits, imbezle depoſitions, pack Juries, draw Witneſſes, if not make them; I know the labour and pains of a faithful and honeſt Attorney is great, and very painful and laborious, in running from Office to Office, from Clerk to Clerk, Officer to Officer, Councel to Councel, Judge to Judge, Court to Court; neither do I here queſtion their proceedings, who make ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law or conſtant practice their rule; But theſe rude, ignorant, young heads, who think and make it their way to gain practice, to over-reach, &amp;c. (though I in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on am as <hi>Mountague</hi> ſaid of learned <hi>Selden,</hi> an Heretique in the faculty as to the whole managery of the Law) who although the Law doth ſufficiently provide againſt, which were by the careleſneſs or faithleſneſs of the Judges in their truſts, through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance as aforeſaid, grown to an infinite number beyond what they were; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in the time when by Statute of 33. <hi>Hen.</hi> the 6. they were limited in <hi>Suffolk,</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:105181:33"/> 
                     <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Norwich,</hi> where they abounded; but they are now bound appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Trade, as well as to tapping, whether of wine or beer; why not as well to Brothelling? and it is thought unjuſt to put any by his practice, though they ruine the Nation by it, at leaſt bring a deluge of poverty upon the people.</p>
                  <p>Yet theſe put the Lawyers alſo upon hard ſhifts; for now the Office of an Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is to practice all the parts of a Lawyer; he drawes all pleas, or generally all but ſome ſpeciall ones upon ſome difficult point; and in that ſome one old beaten book-man in a County is famous; but for making of Wills, and drawing all ſorts of conveyances or Covenants, with ſtrange niceties of form, and cautelous qualifications, limitations, proviſoes, and ſuch like, none like them; they not ſo much looking at their firſt trading into reaſon, and ſolid cauſes, or grounds of things, as into the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial niceties, as the readieſt way to purchaſe practice with cunning knaves, and moſt affecting wit and youth, and ſo are drawn into a way of evill before they be aware, and after it is hard to reclaim them; and for keeping of thoſe peſtilences off of <hi>England,</hi> Lords Courts, they take all the work, which was heretofore the way of educating and bringing into practice the young Lawyer.</p>
                  <p>And in theſe laſt times there ſprung up firſt under the wings of Noblemen, and men of great eſtate, for the help of the Attorney in Judicial Courts, but as Attorney in the Prerogative ones, a creature called a Sollicitor; theſe men rob both Lawyer and Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and all the Subjects: They are oft declamed againſt by the Lawyers, but no courſe taken to reſtrain them, many of them practizing as Attornies, under the wing or name of an Attorney; what fee he hath thus to abuſe the Laws and his own fellow practitioners, I know not, but many faults and errours are hereby committed; and where to fix it, is not eaſily diſcerned; and great men love not to take great pains in ſuch diſcoveries, without exceeding great profit; few I fear do juſtice for the love of juſtice; ſo that having ſhifted from Sollicitor preſent, to Attorney abſent, 'tis for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; if remembred, the fault is laid upon the Clerk; the Clerk he turns you back again to them inſtructed him, which happily is neither Sollicitor, nor Attorney, but a ſtranger unknown, or a ſervant gone: But it is objected, you have your remedy at Law againſt an Attorney in any cauſe againſt Law: So ſay I; but he hath his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that ſpares charges, he hath councel for nothing, and cunning (ſo called kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very) to boot: And laſtly, the Judge muſt as much as may be favour a ſervant of the Court, that is, he ſhall have all lawful favour, and the other all lawful disfavour; and put any Lawyer to ſue an Attorney upon theſe terms, and the Attorney will undoe him.</p>
                  <p>To paſs over the nicety of going to iſſue, pleading ſpecially when the generall iſſue would ſerve the turn, or ſuch like; nor to ſhew how many ſeveral ſorts of delayes the ſeveral Courts admit, I ſhall ſhortly come to the tryal, which is either in the ordinary ſet places, as the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> or <hi>per niſi prius,</hi> where there is ſuch hudling, ſhuffling, quircks of law, unequal hearing, and both for honour, as the Kings or Queens Councel order as Benchers, &amp;c. except favour ſtep in, and then the ſon of a Iudge or Kinſman, &amp;c. muſt make all the Councel attend till he ſpeaks (nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe too too often) ſo that I have heard wiſe and learned men profeſs, they were aſhamed to ſee great men and Favourites manage the buſineſs out of all order and rule of law, while they knowing in practice (as they term it) that is, verſed in the Miniſtery of the cauſe, could not be heard a word, as if they were retained only to hold the paper and cry, My Lord; 'tis truth, there is another reaſon in it, which is, they have ſuch multitude of Councel, that all cannot ſpeak, and the great men muſt ſpeak beſt reaſon; for have not the Prince the choyce?</p>
                  <p>Some indeed, either would be heard through boldneſs, or muſt be heard through neceſsity, as undertaking Caſes which others either durſt not, or could not; as <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born</hi> with that noble Judge the Lord Chief Iuſtice <hi>St. John,</hi> in the Caſe of Ship Mony; and this was a ſtep to advancement, if they ſhewed ability, and could turn with the tide, or were thought fit of for ſome other by-reſpect, as to have their mouthes ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped againſt Prerogative, and opened as far as the Law would admit for the Kings ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: Thus were learned <hi>Calthorp</hi> engaged, and the foreſaid now Lord <hi>St. John,</hi> though as I have (to his honour be it ſpoken) heard it credibly affirmed, he denyed to be the Kings Servant upon the Lords day at Councel Table (pardon this neceſſary
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105181:33"/> digreſsion, both here and in many other places purpoſely done to avoid treating of theſe things by themſelves) ſo that unleſs the Iudge were very wiſe and reſolute, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving theſe ſo many traps, he might ore-ſlip ſomething, how juſt ſoever his intentions were; and the Lawyer might by the like means be drawn to ſome errour in point of Legal advice, as well as the Attorney in practice; for 'tis evident, or will be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after manifeſted, that to gain a certainty of Law, we ran into all incertainty that might be. To ſpeak of the errours of the Judges ſervants and their Marſhals, abuſing both Law, Judge, and Countrey for expedition money, and taking what fees they liſt, and new Fees, though it be material; yet carrying with it the aſſured errour of his maſter, who ought to know it better then the Countrey can tell; I willingly paſs it over; but muſt inſert, that ſeldome a Jury is legally pannelled; or if legally, having outward legal qualifications, yet not knowing men able to diſcern into the now uſed courſe of evidence; for it is pitty to ſee, if not pre-ingaged, which is too too often; they generally either follow the fore-man, or hearken to ſuch a Councellour, or elſe are tyed to what the Iudge ſeems to incline to, when he repeats the evidence, which to avoid ſuch leadings, might be ſpared; but in the confuſion of the Councels thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, if not falſe ſpeakings, and miſ-recitals, in their ſo claimed due of ſumming up the evidence, cannot be wel forborn, without a greater miſchief then the other poſſible, yet ſeldome ſeen palpable inconvenience. I might evidence the ſame courſe of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in all ſubſequent proceedings till execution; but I haſte.</p>
                  <p>Theſe with hundreds of more common abuſes in the Law, which did indeed render both Law and Lawyers odious; for this was grown uſuall, to get by any means, or having gotten, though juſtly, to keep by any means, and hold play with the others eſtate; for they could upon a Bond, for example, drive off with good words a quiet man and fore-handed, or a poor man, or Orphan, in regard of their relyance upon the penalty, which in regard of the poſsible evils, was now grown double, as 200. l. for 100. l. five or ſix years, or more, then plead <hi>non eſt factum;</hi> that is, it was not their deed, the Witneſſes happily dead, and no other or difficult circumſtance appearing, Verdict is either loſt, or hardly gained, if it be a ſmall ſum, and the Verdict againſt the Plaintiff, he is not able to get any advantage, but by renuing ſuit in <hi>Chancery</hi> to put him to his oath, where the charges is ſo great he is undone: If the Verdict go on his ſide, then there is motion for ſtay of judgement to delay; if that over-ruled, then a Writ of Errour; if that over-ruled, then the Cauſe is not ſent by the Iudges or Iuſtices to the <hi>Chancery,</hi> upon a ſight of the equity of the cauſe, as the ancient Law in <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. was, or ſeems to be but of courſe to delay, except the Plaintiff dye in the time, and then all is loſt without hope of recovery; and the <hi>Chancery</hi> by right is held not to have any cognizance of any caſe under 20. l. as if no conſcience or equity were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in leſſer matters, where the falſity of formal cuſtomary ſurmizes be ſuch, that the ſimplicity, that is, ſincerity or plain righteous dealing of the firſt Heathen Law-givers ſeverely puniſhed, when they firſt inſtituted complaints to be in writing, puniſhing him that complained of what he could not prove.</p>
                  <p>O the exceſſive unwarrantable proceedings in falſe ſuggeſtions and ſurmizes! yet by theſe with ſuch like practize in proceeding as in the beginning the cauſe may grow to 7, 8, 10, 12, 20. years continuance, although the late Lord <hi>Littleton</hi> (who dyed in the ſtrife betwixt loyalty ſo called to his King, and to the Commonwealth, and was van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by perſonal reſpects) did openly profeſs, at his call to that high and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable imployment, in his ſpeech in the Court at his taking the place, That he had heard cauſes had depended there 12. years, but knew no cauſe they ſhould depend 13. moneths, and reſolved then to ſpeed an end of all laſting cauſes, and began with <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eocks;</hi> But when the Barr began to grow thin, I ſay not he changed his mind, but his courſe; pretence of other buſineſs drew him like others before him, to haſty hearings, half hearings, references, and ſubitane Orders, which with the lazineſs of Iudges and Maſters of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> but eſpecially the wickedneſs of Clerks and Regiſters is the ſqueeze of the Subjects purſe; for all men know who have had any experience in the world, that the Regiſter makes the Order, rather then the Iudge: A chief means of continuing which evil, is (next after the want of due care of the Iudges, to read the Order fair written before he riſe) want of a ſet ſtipend, while he by more work gets more gain.</p>
                  <p>The laſt, is, want of ſharp and ſpeedy puniſhment of an offender; this makes
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105181:34"/> Orders paſt the ordinary length, and infinitely beyond the rule of Juſtice in Tale, above 40 Orders in a caſe (Mr. <hi>Noy</hi>) or I am deceived, moved before the Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry,</hi> when he durſt ſay, (that was Kings Attorney) my Lord I move upon the 49 Order (to my beſt remembrance) ſo that the by-word was upon a ſuit in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> you have gotten into a ſute of Buff: Theſe things never pierced the conſcience of theſe men, they followed the example of their predeceſſors, and grew by degrees worſe and worſe; and thus it was alſo upon all other proceedings at Law in all Courts, whether upon criminal cauſes, or other offences againſt the publike or civil Laws ſo called, or between perſon and perſon; another evil was both in law and equity, the priviledge firſt of places, then of perſons.</p>
                  <p>That of places partly ariſing from Order, ſo called Divine, that is, from the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ſimilitudinary holineſs of the Temple; And therefore as the Churches were in the time of Popery, and now new pleaded for Popery, as the Cities of refuge of old; and the ſo called Clergy ſtill as aforeſaid, Idolatrouſly continued with us, ſo other places were now priviledged, and made the Sanctuaries for offenders, which were the ſhelter for all inſolencies, tumults, diſorders, and wickedneſs, which places were firſt of ſeparate or ſpecial juriſdiction, as Cathedrals, Minſters, and ſuch other liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ariſing from pretended Eccleſiaſtick Right and Title under the Hierarchie Papal.</p>
                  <p>The other was of the Kings Court, Lords Houſes, Inns of Court and Chancery, the Seminaries as they ought to be of good Government and ſingular examples of order; the perſons priviledged were the King, whoſe perſon the Laws as lately expounded had generally freed from all cenſure, and purged all taints by the Crown, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his abſolute Miniſters was laboured much againſt; now the reaſon of this was to uphold what was gained, and to gain what might be for the King; therefore the Lords as the King muſt have their priviledge; and as the King muſt not be ſued but by Petition, a Royal cheat; ſo the Lords muſt not be arreſted but by prayer, a Noble flattery; but a moſt grand abuſe aroſe from this; for much coſt did many beſtow to get the King, Queen, and Lords into their debt, who never gained more then undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (the recompence of foolery) by their knaveries, and multitudes of debtors and treſpaſſors bearded Law and Juſtice both.</p>
                  <p>Now for Judges, Counſellors, Attorneys, Lawyers of all ſorts, or pretenders there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the other perſons priviledged, they ſtuck together like brethren, ſo that hard it was to pinch them, eſpecially two, the Judge for his power, and the Attorney for his priviledges; but of this before ſufficient for the preſent intention. Thus were all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in diſtaſt, as to the great and principal ruling part of the Commonwealth; and head, and heart thus ſick, the body ſure was in a diſtemper: for all the Courts indeed, from the County Court to the Court of Pypowder, which I think is (one at leaſt of) the loweſt, followed the track in proportion of all the tricks, quiddities, niceties of unjuſt, dilatory and expenſive lawing, uſed in the high ſo called, and ſupream Courts of judicature.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall but hint the abuſe in Witneſſes, there being now grown viſibly many more juſt exceptions againſt men then the old Laws allowed.</p>
                  <p>But the great evil in all Courts, was, and is, that the indeed common and moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary queſtions were not determined and ſetled.</p>
                  <p>Matters of Accompt, matters of Covenant, which hold partly an equitable, partly a legal right, determinations of litigious queſtions in Wills; as in caſe of a name mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, in caſe of a gift given to a child payable under age, who ſhall acquit the party that payes it; nay indeed the ancient law concerning acquittances real and perſonal, to me ſeems loſt.</p>
                  <p>To ravel all and ſhew the utmoſt of abſurdity, error, and perverſneſs grown upon our Courts, Lawes and Lawyers, is not by one pen to be declared; all is out of order; I will ceaſe to tell what all know and complain of; there is nothing ſought but riches and honour, by what means ſoever; I wiſh the Seats of Judgement had been clear of receiving moneys, ſo called, Dammage clear, which ſhortly is thus:</p>
                  <p>A man ſues and recovers; now by the Law there is a ſuppoſall (and but a ſuppoſall, if that be to be ſuppoſed, which is well known to the contrary) that the Recoverer hath his debt, or his damage and coſts of ſuit; now the firſt Law holding forth, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105181:34"/> looking at a kind of equity, if the ſuit were for ſo ſmall a matter that it exceed not 3. li. 6. s. 8. d. recovered, then it took nothing; but if it were more, then it took two ſhillings upon every pound. Now although I ſuppoſe at the original this was or ought to have been a ſufficiency to have tryed the Cauſe, and to be added to the Judgement, and paid by the Defendant, yet now it comes only to the Maſter of the Office, who aſſigns Coſts upon the Judgement, and this is paid before Execution, which the party happily never lives to ſee performed; this was as to a moity allowed in the Upper Bench. But in the Term, called <hi>Eaſter Term,</hi> 1649. it was as an oppreſſion; taken off by the Judges; a ſmall beginning to a great work, but fit to operate the clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way; but is ſtill continued in the ſo called Common Pleas.</p>
                  <p>In probate of Wills, and ſuing out Adminiſtrations to whom it belongs, whether accomptable, if divers children, or the wife to have all, or the eldeſt child all, and the reſt nothing, with a thouſand other things, are ſo difficult in Law, though eaſie in Reaſon, as cannot but be the wonder of any one that ſets himſelfe to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſpeak a little of the Titles by way of Feofment, or bargain and ſale, what a world of difficulty in them! I dare ſay, never a Lawyer in <hi>England</hi> can (eſpecially in the moſt excellent tenure of the land) aſſure to any man a good Title, neither Knight nor Lord; and all aroſe,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from the want of care in Judges authorized to enact Laws, who heard of cheatings, and yet gave no ſtop; for this is ſure, he that is able and ſells not for need, but for conveniency to better himſelf otherwhere, will not deceive groſly, becauſe he knows it brings ſcandal as much as charge and trouble, though his conſcience be but looſe; but the poor needy Prodigal, that drinks away thrift, and hardly knows, and little cares what he does, he it is that falls upon this trick, and he firſt entayles, then mortgages, then ſells: The entayle is ſetled by the wives friends to ſecure the eſtate to her and her children; they keep this ſecret; but to keep their credit they will not borrow the money, nor commonly witneſs the Mortgage: Thus hath he all his deeds, and the diſcent appears fair or the bequeſt, 'tis ſold to redeem the Mortgage, the deeds and ſtate; all parts from the Mortgage, and the buyer thinks himſelf ſecure, but is cheated, and the Statute of fraudulent conveyances ſhall not help, &amp;c. and all the recompence he hath, is the Creditors body, if he can catch it; Lands ſo ſetled, pay no debts.</p>
                  <p>Another way of cheat, is the Statute of Uſes, ſetling of eſtates in truſt to deceive, making long Leaſes, and ſuch like: This filled the world with infinite jangles; and although an eaſie and ſpeedy remedy were propoſed both to King <hi>James,</hi> and the late King; yet the intereſt of the Lawyers being now made ſubſervient to Prerogative, all was quaſhed; ſo that the Land was filled with multitudes of oppreſſions, cruelties, cheatings, and extortions, and no remedy, and the Lawyers only enriched thereby, with the Officers of Courts, upon long, tedious and intricated controverſies; they were alſo vexed with old ſleeping judgements, which no time being ſet unto, it was the faſhion to keep money in hand upon a purchaſe to clear incumbrances, and that kept was ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome paid; for to ſay there was no encomber amid ſo many wayes, was difficult; to ſwear it to no end; but to prove it impoſſible: thus if an honeſt ſeller met with a knave a rich and contentious, or contentious buyer only, he gat it not, or ſo that he had as good have loſt it: So for Annuities, Rents, &amp;c. Again, for conveying, there was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and ſeiſin, the ſuppoſed abſolute ſtrength, a fine, and the late paſſage by enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet none of theſe abſolutely certain; for the fine though ſtrongeſt, and the five years limited paſſed, yet if the ſeller had no right at the time, as many had not being neither heir, purchaſer, nor poſſeſſor, the fine wrought not; yet this not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by all the writings produced, which ſhewed good title; the livery voided <hi>per</hi> ſome prior leaſe, and the enrolment not done in due time: Indeed almoſt all good Statutes are by the looſneſs of Judges invalidated; for ſo ſoon as honeſt men provide remedy againſt an evil preſent, and emergent by act, it is the knaves work to converſe with a quick brained little conſcienced Lawyer, and crafty Attorney, to find a looſe from the Law, which is too oft allowed, and the Judge excuſes himſelf by the letter of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I ſhall now generally declare that the whole frame and foundation of <hi>Englands</hi> Government was looſed, rotten, and vaniſhed, which I thus manifeſt; Look
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105181:35"/> at the Lands, and its evident, that had <hi>Noy</hi> lived, or but the Parliament been deferred, the moſt conſiderable part of the Kingdom had been Forreſt; upon the claiming of which, what quick work was made in ſome places, few but know; that which had not been Forreſt to the King, would all have been ſecured to him by Office, as holding in Chief, or forfeiture otherwayes, either upon the chief Lords, or ſome inferiours want of Service: And as the King had dealt with his great men, ſo would they with their Tenants, whether Knights or Soccagers; but eſpecially the Copy-holders ſhould have ſuffered without remedy; for it was grown to this, that as no Jury durſt find againſt the King, if a ſtrong conteſt were, that is, if it were a matter worth the ſtriving for (and ſuppoſed to be, or might be a flowre of the Crown) ſo neither durſt any find againſt the Lord; nor indeed well could they tell how to do right, either to the Lord, or between the particular Tenants; for the Copies were generally brought to this courſe, only to name ſo many, &amp;c. of the Tenants, R. or B. &amp;c. the Rent they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to ſet down, ſo that the Bailiff cheated the Tenant, but eſpecially the honeſt or ignorant one at his pleaſure, and exerciſed more power, rather Tyranny, then a Prince; for the Fines, they generally drew them to the meer Will of the Lord, and in that were abſolutely illegall; and although it was pretended the Chancery was the moderator, that was but to help the Lord; for not one man of a thouſand would conteſt; if rich, ſeldom but he was a Lord, for every Peaſant was now become the purchaſer of a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; if poor, the controverſie ruined him; Now let us a little here look at the nature of Copyholds.</p>
                  <p>Which I conceive came in thus at the Norman Conqueſt upon the ſetling of his Commonwealth, as he had laid his frame, that is, that all held of the Crown mediatly or immediatly; that is they by greater ſervices, as Dukes, Earls, &amp;c. and the inferiour Lords of them, ſo all theſe Lords had their inferiors under them; that as they ſerved the King in his Wars to preſerve the publique, ſo theſe might ſerve the neceſſities of the ptivate Families, as Soccagers to plow, ſow, and cut down, &amp;c. and Villains to carry muck, and do all drudgery or meaner work, and were both but a kind of ſervants; the one yet more free, as having his Land, only paying his Rent, Corn, &amp;c. the other abſolutely bound, over whom he had at firſt power of life, and goods, and all; both yet of which, as the Nation grew civilized and religious, got more liberty and priviledge, ſo that they became abſolutely free; and their preſent conditions are ſo diverſe from paſt, though the names remain, that a man will hardly believe ſuch things were.</p>
                  <p>Yet from theſe, divers harſh villanous Cuſtomes and uſages are ſtill continued; all, or any, and every of which are unreaſonable and unwarrantable; for the villain or bondman, his Land was his Lords, as was himſelf, his wife and children.</p>
                  <p>After it was given him under a Service, but he could not give nor grant; then Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices were turned into Rents, yet he had no power to diſpoſe, all was in the Lord; after the policy of the Kingdom being depraved, and theſe villains being grown too numerous, taking advantage of civill diſſention among the Maſters, the Servants gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the priviledge of inheritance, but not to paſs it by free Deeds, or grant, or ſell, but to deſcend; at laſt they came to ſell, and uſage only regulated all this, and then were uſed as free Lands, all but the way of paſſing it, which matter of form is moſt highly penall, even to forfeiture, and indeed theſe forfeitures are the ſole end of moſt Lords.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe evils of forfeitures and the like, though for ſmall cauſes are grown exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing penall, moſtly from the difficulties and delays of Law, but enough from the rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, unjuſt and cruel principles of the ſo called Lords of Mannors, which now each greedy griping rich man is purchaſer of, and the value according to uſage ſet accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. Now theſe evils ariſe thus, Firſt all the Jury, who enquire of the forfeiture, are the Lords Tenants, and thoſe that are pannelled are not able or rich, or commonly of any great reach; and the Steward moſt commonly an Attorney, he is the meer penti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner of the ſo called Lord, and his improvement of his fortune is to improve his Lords Rents or eſtate, and that is by ſearching out old antiquated Evidences for original Agreements, Compoſitions, or the firſt or primitive Cuſtome, and then pinch a poor weak Tenant upon that Cuſtome, and he ſubmitting, another, and ſo on, till all or the moſt be buxome, and who is able to withſtand?</p>
                  <p>If it be quaeried why ſome rich man oppoſes not; it is anſwered, few rich men, but are either Countrimen, and then either are,, or expect to be Lords; if Citizens, their gaines are great, and are not deſirous to ſpend their eſtates to inrich Lawyers; and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105181:35"/> thus Lords and Clowns got into things called ſtill Mannors, broken, divided and ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, no way retaining their original conſtitution, through the baſeneſs of Kings, Judges, and Officers, and the intereſt of Parliament men, few of them whoſe cauſe it is not; the ſubject, eſpecially the poor, is kept in a baſe unworthy vaſſalage, under the conſtitution of the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, and free men engaged by the tenure of lands, and by prevailing and unregarded Cuſtome, to a ſlavery which was abhorred in the King, yet uſurped by fellow ſubjects upon each other, and that with Prerogatives higher then in any the Princes Courts; for the common priviledges of extraction and profeſſion, are no way pleadable againſt their Fines and Amerciaments; ſo that I have known a profeſſing Eſquire take of a Chriſtian, a Knight and Barronet, his neighbour, fourty ſhillings for Amerciaments for not attending at his Court, which was paid by him onely with this proteſt by his Steward, that that fourty ſhillings ſhould get his Maſter twenty pound <hi>per annum;</hi> and where they may call a Court as oft as they liſt, and too often, as ſome widdows, ſo called Ladys of Mannors holding it but for Life, do; it muſt be as burdenſome as unjuſt. Beſides, there is nothing certain in any Court, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Ground, or the Rent, or the Fine, or the Cuſtome, but the legal pated Steward can, to wreack his ſpleen, finde a flaw in, and laying his land onely by ſo much in ſuch a place, if any ground be wood or rich, that is the Lords at laſt; and though, as the Law held forth a plauſible remedy to all miſchiefs, ſo to this in the Chancery; yet it hath been generally found the remedy was ſo far off, and ſo dearly purchaſed, that it was as evil, if not worſe then the diſeaſe; and though theſe Courts might do ſome good heretofore, yet now there accrued no advantage to the Commonwealth by them, except the multiplying of Atturnies, Alehouſes, and ſuits were a preſervative for a languiſhing State.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak of Arbitrary Fines, how intolerable, illegal and inconvenient, were to no purpoſe; but all theſe evils grew in the Reign of <hi>Charls</hi> to an exceſſive burthen.</p>
                  <p>An other growing evil was the multitudes of poor, which aroſe as naturally from a long peace; and ſecondly, from a want of a legal approved way of disburthening the Commonwealth by Plantations, other then voluntary, leſt priviledge of the ſubject ſhould be touched upon, ſo fell it out.</p>
                  <p>A third reaſon was the multitude of Inns and Alehouſes; the Inns grew upon an old Law, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſcorned the lazy life of an Hoſt, aad there were few Inns, yea too few for to lodge Ttavellers; therefore the Law debarred none from taking up that Trade; and the Lawyers not having a judgment againſt it, ſay it is Law ſtill, though the Reaſon ceaſed long ſince: The other is of Alehouſes multiplying in all places; ſure for by-reſpects, as knowing much drinking raiſes Malt, and that Barley; and ſo the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen let their lands, and rack their rents more; ſo it fills the rich mans purſe, and empties the poors: Next, it was the ordinary advancement of a Knights, Juſtices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> over-worn Cook-maide, or his Groom, or happily a caſt Fallconers fee, or Huntſmans, as the pentions which are now out of the caſualties originally inſtituted for maimed ſouldiers. Fourthly, and moſt imprudently, from the laxation of Laws in the Juſtitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Nation; for whereas King <hi>James</hi> found the Nation ſo governed, that they who could not maintain a wife, might not marry; for a Licenſe they could not have, the Biſhops taking care enough with their Officers that the poor might not have lawful favor of a Licence, leſt their Hoſpitality might be charged, or impaired by their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and their publike denouncing the bands of Marriage the fiſt time; the Pariſh for the like cauſe hindred it the ſecond, if any cauſe were; &amp; uſually none were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted marriage till the man were thirty five at leaſt, and the woman thirty, whereas ſince they coupled at fourteen, fifteen, ſixteen, ſeventeen, eighteen a great age; this hath bred multitudes of poor, weak and tender poor; and ſo for want of due proviſion roguiſh lazy poor; for many Statues are, but all to ſmall purpoſe; ſome men being ſo chary of particular priviledges that they have undone the publike, and to ſave a Rogue or Whore from whipping, have ſtarved thouſands to death; For this was the courſe of <hi>Englands</hi> good general Government, they were all one body, and that as men, ſo as Chriſtians; and therefore what the Pariſh ſo called could not perform, the next muſt; if that ſerved not, the hundred muſt; if not that, the County, and ſo forth, and this both for a ſtock for work for thoſe could work, whereby they knew the laborious poor, and lazy poor, and could afford incouragement or diſcouragement accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Next for maintenance for thoſe could not work, or not to maintain their charge ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105181:36"/> This now was in times of Popery reaſonably ſupplied, partly by the Deacons, the proper Church Officer, and partly by the civil Officers of the Town, Charity being then the high ſtep to heaven, applauded by men, as declared by <hi>Paul;</hi> and though the great Charity went to Monaſteries, Frieries, Nunneries; yet theſe were pipes which afforded ſome refreſhment to the hungry, thirſty, both ſtrangers and domeſtike; but now there were new Laws, new Proviſions, new Officers, and all to make ſupply; yet the work grew ſo difficult it over-maſtered the Actors, partly from the reaſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, but more from the niceneſs grown upon the Law; ſo that the Juſtice of the Peace knew not what to do; whip a Rogue, or looſe perſon, or ſuch as the Law held forth ſeemingly liable to the laſh, he was ſued, and there wanted either ſuch cauſe as Maſter chief Juſtice thought fit; a Warrant of Commitment, or a legal ſo called Warrant, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it expreſſed no cauſe, or not thought ſufficient cauſe, yet the cauſe in it ſelf more then enough; either it was to Bridewel where it ſhould be to the Gaol, or the Gaol where it ſhould have been to Bridewel; this for Rogues: Then for idle people that would not work, the due order of aſſeſſing wages was left; ſo that what Rule to keep, who could tell? multitude of young people living at their own hand; ſome commonly reputed to live whoriſhly, others knaviſhly, others theeviſhly, for they neither wrought, nor had of their own, yet lived highly; to complain was unneighbourly: ſo they went on; yet if complained of, what could be done? they anſwered they would have Services if they could; yet if in Service, they would do nothing, nor tarry but their own pleaſure, or do but what work they pleaſed, and wages they would have as they liſt, and compound to do what they liſt or be gone; and the Juſtices were ſo terrified by the Judges, and the Maſters by the length of ſuits, as all was grown to looſe liberty.</p>
                  <p>For the binding out of Apprentiſes, a good and wholſome Law, that the poor edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in better mens houſes might be trained up to be fit for imployment, as Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and otherwayes; truly through the pettiſh wilfulneſs or niggardlineſs of ſome men in Authority, it was aſſumed to be againſt the liberty of the Subject, to impoſe a ſervant upon him; and few or none will take willingly, ſo that the Law requires it, but none looks at execution; if any do, the particular Juſtices muſt upon refuſal binde them over to the Seſsions, where he ſhall be plagued, and as he ſaith, malitiouſly vexed with attendance, and pay fees, and then nothing is done: 'Tis truth, the Law holds forth a way of raiſing ſtock to put forth Apprentiſes; but this is as litigious; for there is much ado to make a Rate; if they will not do it, binde them over to the Seſſions is all, and there Lawyers make ſuch work for their Clients, as home they go without Fine or other puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>And generally the great perſons are moſt backward; many think ſcorn to be rated by their neighbours, and if they rate them, they will pay nothing, or not above their eſtate there, which happily is two or three hundred pound <hi>per annum,</hi> and may come to ſix pence or eight pence <hi>per</hi> moneth and they have one, two, three, four, five, ſix, ſeven, eight, ten, twelve, twenty thouſand it may be; and how do they ſpend it, but in pride, riot, vain exceſſes? for generally they either live in Cities, and then charge them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways then they like, or liſt, they are gone; or in ſmall Towns, that is, where they may have no neighbours, and there they have Cottagers ſervants, but no other; and ſome by this means pay not one penny in a year to the poor but their offall; well, they make a Rate, the payment is refuſed, what courſe now to come by it? ſome Rates are to demand, and within ſix days a diſtreſs, others within four days; ſome by the Conſtable, ſome by Warrant from the Juſtice of Peace that ſigned the Rate; ſome of any Juſtice; ſome the diſtreſs is taken to be ſold preſently, ſome within four, ſome ſix, ſome eight, ſome ten dayes, ſome the overplus is to be returned; ſome deducting charges, ſome certain charges, ſome incertainly; and ſo for Forfeitures, and ſo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; ſome things to be done by one, ſome by two Juſtices, whereof one to be of the <hi>Quorum</hi> upon penal Statute Laws <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe variety of Laws were the Lawyers gins; for ſeldom but the poor Officer ſmarted, for that the Juſtice to avoid quarrel with him, left his Warrant with this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral clauſe at laſt according to Law; which the poor Conſtable taking ſimply, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the literal Tenor of the Warrant, he ſeldom went according to Law: Thus was all due proceeding, and the ſubſtance of Government loſt, to preſerve a fair husk of ſo called priviledge of the Subject; but the husks vertue had this attractive, that all the idle money, and good money of the Nation was dreyned into the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105181:36"/> Lawyers purſes, and the difficulty of the Law was invented by them aſſuredly on ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> purpoſe onely to keep up the Trade, and not diſcovered by the Judges, nor diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenanced, upon the principle that every one had their times; ſo letting of ſervants at Petty-Seſſions, and their not departure without a teſtimony, and ſuch like, all grown to diſorder; and the rather becauſe now even the honors of the Kingdom were as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid made mercenary to the ends of Covetize and Tyranny; and the debauchery of the Gentry ſpoiled the whole Nation, ſo that the ancient Gentry, whether of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> or <hi>Norman</hi> Race, was loſt wholly in the puddle of foolery and faſhion; ſo that put a childe into either a rich man, or Gentlemans houſe, and they learned nothing but the foundation of beggary, they there growing onely nice, neate, luſtfull and lazy.</p>
                  <p>But to return, Thus were the Juſtices and all Officers made tender in execution of the Law; and thus the Law extinguiſhed: And hence it grew, that even Felons, Murderers, and all criminous perſons had at laſt as much favor, as baſeneſs, negligence and ſecurity could afford; for no Hues and Cries were at all proſecuted with effect; for no puniſhment where they ceaſed, and the burthens of Conſtables in their ſervices were ſuch, and the office now put on the meaneſt perſons for vexation, that little knowledge he had of his work; he ignorant, and the Law thorny, both for underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and execution, ſo that he onely put off the work; but to act vigorouſly, or with care he durſt not, leſt his own fire ſhould burn his own fingers: for if he were dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and apprehended a Rogue, he was bound over ſometimes to proſecute the Rogue or Felon for want of an Attorney for the King, or his not executing his place duly; yet all Proceſſes were by indictment at the Kings ſuit, but however as a witneſs; and Indictings, and Recognizance Fees made them ſoon weary, beſides three or four dayes attendance, and not one penny for all their charges. Thus were Rogues incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and obſtructors, and diſobedient to the Law, Government and Reaſon, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Covetize, or worſe ends ſake is evident.</p>
                  <p>But the juſtly feared end of all this by wiſe men, was, that by the iniquity of this frame now wholly and viſibly naught and loſt, the Subject might be enforced to ſubmit to ſuch Rules of Arbitrary Government, as the King by his Edicts, whether perſonal, or from his private Councel, ſhould ſend forth; to which all they of his Councel were fitted, and all his Lords and Gentry to them by the means aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>Now that this evil is faln upon us, is evident: is it not known to all, there was no due return of Warrants by the Conſtables for execution of Juſtice twixt man and man, but that the party muſt enforce or ſecure the Officer, or nothing done? yea, the Sheriffs of Counties from the nicities of Laws would not execute a judgement without ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to bear harmleſs, rather venturing breach of oath then the rigidity of a ſuit.</p>
                  <p>Now one Reaſon will manifeſt this was not unneceſſary on their part; for their at leaſt practiſe of the Law did bear, that if execution were upon another mans goods, though in the ſhop of the party, and of the ſame condition with his Trade, yet upon a Trover and Converſion (a figmentious Action) the Sheriff muſt be overthrown; theſe were the ways to prepare the Free people of <hi>England</hi> to ſlavery and abſolute vaſſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, they doting upon their ſo called Laws: The Biſhops corrupted the Prince, the Princes corrupted the Judges, and they being the ſpeaking Law, the dead letter did little good; ſo that it was time for <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> to look to themſelves; here were Symptoms enough of ruine, threatned both to ſoul and body and eſtate; but the wayes were dark; for the contrivances were fitted to every capacity; ſay Popery was intended, nothing leſs, the Laws ſharp, and execution viſible; as to the firſt part, calling in queſtion, indicting and conviction, all this brought gain: The next ſtep was gain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that is, diſcharge upon compoſition.</p>
                  <p>Say Tyranny was intended to be introduced; no, you have your Judges, both ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in the ordinary Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and Itinerary in the Counties, and they gave the Law; where was the King to be blamed? this ſuggeſted, and the evil continuing, the King walks higher, and by Pattents of grace ſo called, that is, the meer Will of the King, he inhibits ſubjects their Trades, and under a colour of miſchief brings in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience; that is, to prevent an incertain charge or loſs, he impoſes a certain charge, and this contrary to Statute-Law; theſe were called Monopolies; <hi>London</hi> gained as much by this deſtructive chaffer as any place; truly engroſſing all Trade to her ſelf under pretence of regulation, which is neceſſary for the outward formal pretences of Companies of Merchants, for well-making, ordering, ſelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:105181:37"/> of commodity is good; but to leave them that are Maſters of the company, to the ſole making of the Laws, and execution alſo, is deſtructive; they are like Benchers of Inns of Court (no Sir, lets not make Laws to bind our ſelves) as if the place had given all power to them, they make Laws only ſubſervient to their own ends; I ſhall exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie but in one, petitioned againſt in Parliament; theſe Merchants having places of Mart or ſale, the Maſters agree in private, ſend away their commodities, and ſome dayes after declare where the Mart ſhall be; theirs are either arrived, or half way, or prepared to the voyage, when time's ſo ſcanted to others, if at all poſsible, that the Market is over before they arrive, or near it. They alſo put exceeding charges upon admiſsions, &amp;c. and no accompt but to themſelves, which in the conſequences may be deſtructive, not only to the private perſon, but body politique in amaſsing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>The leſſer Corporations were, for marking, meaſuring, ſealing ſluffs, linnen and woollen, with a Crown Seal forſooth; and theſe were his Majeſties gratuities to the Lord of, &amp;c. Marqueſs, &amp;c. Q. Mother, Lady Nurſe, Groom of the ſtool, that is, the Cloſe ſtool, whether King or Queen (high and advantageous honours) and this diſcended to outlandiſh, as in Land commodities; yea, to pins and brooms; and it was ſaid, to Rags for paper, and Marrow-bones for Kitchin-ſtuff, or greaſe: Next, he found one ſo baſe, as being a Lawyer, to take a pattent to have the firſt motion (in the ſtricteſt ſence) or to be heard in all caſes before any other, which the Judges wiſely quaſhed in the ſhell, hearing him, and ſhewing obedience to power, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled this Patent therein; and then declaring by an intimation of a rigid diſlike, that the Authority pretended could not (that is with ſafety) grant it; for the Lawyers would be ſtirred who had the key of Knowledge, and they once diſaffected might be like a ſpark in powder.</p>
                  <p>All theſe had their ſucceſs, becauſe they by degrees falling upon perſons or trades only, they even upon advice deſiſted generally from more then expoſtulation; ſome few brought Actions, and were killed with delayes and frowns: Then the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a Maſter-piece, which was at once to quaſh all controverſies by a ſleight and ſudden judgment, having a colour of Law, but no ſubſtance; and this was by an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal charge upon the whole body of Subjects, ſo called Ship-Money, which had for foundation thus much:</p>
                  <p>The Kingdom was an Iſle, the defence Shipping, the Navy was decayed, the King muſt repleniſh; ſo he rigs his Ships, and ſends them forth (to take the ayre as the idle ones ſaid, but indeed to inure bodies to the Sea, ſettle them under pay and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and ſo engage dependance) they return; and whereas heretofore the Maritine Counties ſent forth Ships, and the Land towns paid; now the King would provide all Ships, and they all ſhould pay; now this was clearly done only to inhance the ſo called Crown Revenue; for the Subject ſaw no Enemy, and ſo no neceſsity, the original cauſe of that Tax; a general peace was held to the out ſide with all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions after theſlaughter of the gallant <hi>Engliſh</hi> at the Iſle of <hi>Ree,</hi> and the diſmanteling of <hi>Rochel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the upſhot was, the King muſt be judge, nay, ſole Judge of this neceſſity; and this is quaeried by the King to his Judges, which to prove the aſſertion before they were all King trodden, that is, had engaged all their abilities to his meer will, two onely of twelve in this ſo important a buſineſs, as indeed the whole life of the Subjects Liberty was involved in it, as to his eſtate at firſt, and for denyal of that to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, durſt aſſert the truth; which two only I ſhall own as men noble and honeſt, <hi>Crook</hi> and <hi>Hutton;</hi> and though both or one were by the plurality of Votes ingaged to the firſt Quaere</p>
                  <p>Whether the King were ſole Judge; yet upon the Tryal brought by that true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot <hi>Hambden,</hi> they righted themſelves and the Nation to the utmoſt; and honeſt <hi>Crook</hi> ſpake true plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> reaſon, and good Law while mercinaries blundred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the work; and had they taken <hi>Barcley's Argenis,</hi> and read the diſcourſe betwixt <hi>Polyarchus</hi> and <hi>Hyanisbe,</hi> touching ſuch taxes, they had ſaved their credits, as only declaring the judgement of an Alien to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberty, and reſerved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>But now 'twixt Truth and Loyalty ſo called, they were confounded, and gave no ſatisfaction, no not to the well-affected to abſolute powers; and by this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105181:37" rendition="simple:additions"/> all power, the Subject was enboldned to deny, and at laſt, after ſome two or three yeer, the King was enforced to deſiſt; and ſurely his cogitations were for Armies; how providence prevented, there being ſo many diſcourſes of it, I ſhall omit, only with this hint, That theſe fore-runners manifeſtly declare, that the Arms in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> raiſed by his Commiſſion, and continued in <hi>England</hi> againſt the ſame power of Parliament (Aſſertors of the ſame Common Liberty by the Nation owned and peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for) were undoubtedly the effects of the ſame cauſe; namely, the ſubverſion of <hi>Englands</hi> Law and Government, the peoples Liberties and all Rights, making the King by his meer free will the abſolute Arbiter of all actions civil and criminal: Thus in brief, I have ſet down ſome of the viſible preparatives to <hi>Englands</hi> Climaterical Revolution, which it now labours under. In the diſcuſſion of the State of affairs civil, and ſo called Eccleſiaſtick before, but eſpecially in the time of the late King; and all ſhews, that plainly there was left no more then an outſide Chriſtianity, or formal Religion, the temper of the clay of the world, the pravity of Reaſon in the depraved principles of policy; the iron of reaſon in the variety of <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Government; and the gold of Chriſtian ſimplicity, the gold owned in the Scriptures, by Authority al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; the iron in the rational formal profeſſion of the ſame, and the conſequences thereof; the Clay in the falſe and unconſequential gloſſes, to make mans rule and abſolute Government the higeſt and laſt refuge of every man, and that for a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons end, though in publke truſt; for that truſt was ſaid not ſo much to be for the peoples benefit, as his own.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things premiſed, I might omit the paſſages ſince, as being freſh in every mans memory; but at the deſire of ſome, I ſhall go on in the way of a curſory Hiſtorical Narration; repinings and grudgings by and from the actions of the King and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters growing high, ſo that it was not thought fit to proceed without ſome force ready, for fear of inſurrections, which were indeed deſired; and therefore the people were afflicted, that they might rebell and bring themſelves into ſlavery.</p>
                  <p>The King having received the platform of alteration of his State from <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> he is made his Agent to keep on foot a ſtrong Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who, to ſpeak truth, were a company of men fit for as high an attempt as they were intended for, but being Jeſuited in great, if not the greateſt part, they might have double deſigns, that is, rather to embroile all the Kingdomes, and fit them for the tooth of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> their univerſal Patron, then for the Kings abſolute ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>England,</hi> whom they truly knew not to affect the Popes intereſt, further then it ſtood with his own, which is truly the Maxime of all Princes, however they carry it.</p>
                  <p>Upon the confidence of this Army, he is fooled into a quarrel with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and was undoubtedly made beleeve, that to let the <hi>Spaniard</hi> land 10000. in <hi>England,</hi> was the only way to ſet all right; and <hi>Wentworth</hi> a man of depth of policy, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, might over-confidently accept theſe councels; the truth I ſhall not prolixly aſſert, God having providentially cut of that Quaere by the Sword of the <hi>Hollander;</hi> but their courſe, lading, proviſion, number and quantity of men and Commanders, quality of convoy, and backs of carriage, beſides the teſtimony of divers, all tend to demonſtrate the ſame; nor for the ſame reaſon ſhall I argue how croſs and incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent we ſee theſe Councels were; for fools ſee errors when the caſt is plaid, which the wiſe Gameſter ſtudied for, and could not deſcry: This, as it haſtened preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Kings part for war, ſo it enforced him while yet unprepared, to hold out the Enſigns of peace; and what no advices could produce before, is now for inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſake granted, namely, a Parliament, wherein all under-hand proceedings for ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions not being able (ſuch a general diſlike being in all men to the King, and his proceedings) to work and mould it ſerviceable to the Kings ends, he as ſoon diſſolves as calls it.</p>
                  <p>This breeding a deeper diſtaſt, and he not yet fitted; and ſeeing the people now fell upon petitioning rather then rebelling, relying upon the Parliaments united power, rather then upon their ſingle perſonal rights, and would ſooner venture to ſet down with an unjuſt loſs of part from the Kings power, then looſe all to his mercy by an unwarrantable courſe,</p>
                  <p>He calls a Parliament again, and to this Parliament are brought ſo many complaints, that I fear the bulk of Petitions and Remonſtrances will affright our Worthies for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105181:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> looking into them, and let much neceſſary work lye undone, not giving due repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to many perſons againſt publike Theeves and Extortioners; Now the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made no great haſte, and the King was urgent for money: which they taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of, and of his former, not only declining and breaking up or diſſolving Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, but his neglecting his own Laws, that is, thoſe to which he had aſſented; they upon the ground laid in his third year, inſiſt to have an Act for ſetling this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, till diſſolved or prorogued by themſelves, notwithſtanding an act for calling a Parliament every three years, thinking no knot too ſure to hold what they ſtill found looſe; which effected, with ſome other things, they then fall to work with the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> that had power enough to have done all he intended in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of providence, had not vain confidence that he could do it when he would (as the Almighty determined) befooled him; he ſurprized who was the Maſter-dear, the herd flye; and though accuſed by the Kings great Councel; yet his Majeſty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving affections perſonal, notwithſtanding the ſupream publick truſt in ordinary, gives them his paſs, and by the means of his Admiral, they were ſet ſafe a forreign ſhore; and now himſelf labours to his utmoſt the ſafety and preſervation of that man, who had ruled in <hi>Ireland</hi> to his utmoſt in that abſolute way he intended his Maſter here ſhould, as the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> had done in his <hi>France;</hi> the great pleas on his ſide were, what he had done, was for his Maſter the King, by his ſpecial command, for which he had his warrant, and for all Moneys, his diſcharge; and if a further of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence were, it was againſt no exiſtent Law; if Treaſon, &amp;c. not within the Law of 25. of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, which was made with much adviſement, to preſerve the Liberty of the Subject, and conſequently his life by a certain knowledge of his dutie.</p>
                  <p>To which it was anſwered, that his truſt was to the Commonwealth; to the King in his Politique, not in his natural capacity: and his perſonal receit, warrant, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, was not ſufficient, but they had power, yea in caſe he had had a legal allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or diſcharge in ordinary, yet for the Commonwealths ſake which includes both king and people, to call him to an account: And to the laſt part that it was againſt no Law exiſtent, They ſaid the Parliament was by the Stat. Judge of Treaſon <hi>de futuro;</hi> and to orethrow the Laws and government, was more then to deſtroy a perſon: to ruine a kingdom, then kill a king; and therefore (I muſt agree by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity) forced the King to aſſent to his death; which effected, and not dared to be recalled, all plots and policies left are uſed to break up the Parliament, by the King; yea an attempt made upon ſome Members to ſacrifice to the Ghoſt of <hi>Strafford;</hi> but all failing, and yet manifeſted, the Parliament think fit to have a guard; the King practices the Army; the Parliament Vote no leſs then 400000. l. And with that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band the Army; the King thus loſt every way, and the Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> utterly loſt by the grand Rebellion there, taking many of them part with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> if not moſt, and this ſtill giving harſher reſentments to the people, whoſe Liberty was now grown great, and the Parliament loth to hinder them while they ſerved their turns, many not only ſleights, but affronts were put on the Kings ſervants, reflecting upon himſelf. The Biſhops now ſhew their ſure Rock was he, and they wholly cleave to him; the Lords, many joyn with him, many againſt him, and many appear not; the Kings A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, whoſe deſigns had been nipt here, being now in <hi>Denmark, Holland, France</hi> &amp;c. moved for aſſiſtance againſt the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels do there, they ſeek the ſame things, and under the ſame pretexts; ſo that the King is ſaid, and not without ſome ground, to be the chief Actor in all; ſo loth he was to call the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels.</p>
                  <p>This cauſes the Parliament to talk of raiſing Armes, not only to defend themſelves againſt the King, and thoſe with whom he came to the Parliament Houſe, and kept ſtill about him, being generally a crew of Jovialiſts, debaucht perſons;</p>
                  <p>But to offend ſuch publike forreign Enemies, as under the Kings Name ſhould be brought from other Nations, or raiſed here; to which there was ſuch an unanimous loan of all ſorts, eſpecially the Religious, who found a change indeed in their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That they from that took the hint of the ſtrong affections of the people towards them; and upon that Vote the extirpation of Epiſcopacy, the which the King ſo long contending for, and ſo eagerly, ruined himſelf with them. How far this is to be read out of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> I ſhall not quaere; but ſay, it was long foretold out of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105181:38"/> and now fell out; they gave themſelves now to treat of Reformation of the Church; but this rooting up Epiſcopacy took many from them; they had voted and acted againſt pluralities, as to ſettle the Church, and gave the Judges a ſetled and ſufficient ſalary, pretending to take away all other Fees from them, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not.</p>
                  <p>The King fled from <hi>London;</hi> the Convocation they follow his ſhaddow, the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament call themſelves a certain number of men called Miniſters from all parts, and nominate them the Aſſembly; theſe ſit as the Clergy of <hi>England;</hi> the King, after many Traverſes, having gotten together an Army, comes to <hi>Oxford,</hi> whether many come from the Parliament to him, as well as went with him; there he erects or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes a new Parliament. And by their advice, as his Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> demands Treaty with his Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which they reject; and at laſt the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. <hi>London</hi> indeed ſtood true to them, which by its Vicinity to the Parliament, and infinite populacy, awed all other parts; they had a ſence of former ſufferings under the power of Kings; they had a deep ſence of the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities the godly and moſt piouſly affected people ſuffered in all parts of the Nation; and how far the vicinity of the Court, and Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> had violated their Chriſtian Liberty, prevailing over the quiet ſpirit of their Biſhop, was though little, not forgotten; they therefore generally followed the Parliament, eſpecially ſtirred up by their Miniſters, as having in hand the cauſe of God: The King he brands them all with Declarations of Rebellion, and taxing them with ſeeking his life, and the rooting out of his Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>They anſwer, that they were ſo far from ſeeking his life, as that they ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, by all means poſſible, to defend and protect the ſame, their juſt Rights and Priviledges preſerved; and for his ſatisfaction cauſe the Nation generally to enter the like Proteſtation; this not ſatisfying, but it being ſtill urged by the King, that the Proteſtation was but to eſtabliſh their own power, not ſecure his fears;</p>
                  <p>While their Armies were in the field againſt the King; they anſwered, They were only on the defenſive part; and ſuch indeed was the Generals Commiſſion; and that they could not but according to their truſts preſerve the Laws and Rights of the Nation: Hereupon they open the Law, that the King was indeed but the chief truſted perſon, and that for his peoples ſake; that of this not he only, but they alſo, and more eſpecially being congregate into a body were to judge, that his failings paſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, his ends contrary to publike intereſt, and reſolve that even the Law of Nature taught ſelf-preſervation, and that it was too too viſible he intended an uſurpation upon their juſt Priviledges.</p>
                  <p>That they deſired his preſervation, ſo it might conſiſt with the Weal-publick; and therefore deſired him to leave the company of evill men (ſo called his Counſellors) who miſ-led him, and to adhere to his great Councel, and promiſed to make him on theſe terms the moſt Glorious King that ever was in theſe Nations; and now a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe part appearing upon ſeveral grounds and opinions amid the Members of the Houſe, the prevailing party to firm the union betwixt the <hi>Scots</hi> and them more ſtrongly, whoſe aſſiſtance they had had all this while in the work, they frame a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which held forth ſecurity and glory to the King and his poſterity, in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſettle Church and State upon the firm foundations of Juſtice and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which taken in <hi>Scotland</hi> is tranſmitted hither, and they by Parliament made brethren; and this is tendred to the King to ſign, being firſt taken ſolemnly by the principal of the Nation, with this condition.</p>
                  <p>That if the King agreed with them in it, they would ſtill not only acknowledge him their King, but make him more glorious, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But this was ſo penned in ſuch general terms, that an abſolute Royaliſt might well take it; for it was intended by the ſome, I ſay not the many, by the leaders, not the followers, but as a meaſure to try the ſtretch of every mans judgement, opinion, or intereſt; many no doubt took it cordially, many formally, ſome ſtrictly, ſome looſely; but though this were not only taken but urged; yet Armies were continued againſt the King (as he ſaid) in the field, againſt his evil Councel, as they ſaid; 'tis truth, their evil Councel was now his, the Leſſon of abſolute power, and to be like his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; the reſt of the Kings who had joyned intereſt with the Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> made him not only hold correſpondence with that Beaſt, not only at bed and board, but
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105181:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> Councel alſo, as far as ſerved his intereſt, who undoubtedly aimed to rule in all things according to his own Will, which Will, yet, ſhould have had Regulations; but ſtill with ſuch dependence upon his Judgement, that he being the ſpeaking Law, would have had no Interpreter that ſhould be able to croſs him and his determination: and ſo the Law muſt have ſpoken in all things to his luſt, or he would have made it; and this he thought, and I am perſwaded believed to be the undoubted right of all Princes; though their people as his in caſe of conteſt between competitors for the Soveraignty might wring ſomething from them of Grants or Charters, or ſo called priviledges or immunities, which yet he believed they could no more grant to the prejudice of the Crown, that is, of the heirs and ſucceſſors in the Kingdom, then things ſacred to God could be imployed to prophane uſes.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine admitted, which I dare avow was, and can prove ſufficiently by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes yet alive, That our late King <hi>Charls</hi> ſaid theſe words openly upon a Hearing. (Mr. <hi>Hern,</hi> I have heard what you have ſaid; What do you talk to me of Law, Juſtice, or Conſcience? (according to all which Mr. <hi>Herne</hi> alledged the Patent ſigned by his Majeſty to be) I tell you, ſaid the King, there is nothing in <hi>England</hi> ſhall ſtand that is not for my profit; There ſtands one (pointing to Sir <hi>John Banks,</hi> then Attorney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, who had hundred of pounds, many I have heard for the work, and drew the Patent) ſhall bring a <hi>quo warranto</hi> againſt the Patent, and ſee then what you will do.</p>
                  <p>Now take notice this Patent was of the new invention of Salt, and oppoſed the Monopoly at the Sheilds under the favor of deſervedly beheaded <hi>Hambleton,</hi> and the Inventor not complying with the Kings Intereſt againſt the priviledge of the Subject, the King brake not onely his private word with him, contrary to particular engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under his Hand, carried by Sir <hi>Charls Herbert,</hi> but alſo his publike word as King; this ſentence being ſo ruinous to the man, made the Worme ſpeak, and ſaid, Sir, Dare you be a King and be thus unjuſt! I never read of Tyrant ſaid ſo, what ever he did (or words of like effect;) whereupon Lord <hi>Dorcet,</hi> with a great oath (by his Maker, as I expreſs it) ſaid, loe (and if it pleaſe your Majeſty) theſe are your prick-eared Rogues, the Tub-preachers (and indeed he was a Zealot) theſe are they will pluck you out of your Throne, unleſs you dethrone them.</p>
                  <p>I pray take not this Lord for a Prophet, unleſs like <hi>Caiaphas.</hi> This word I could not but inſert for conſcience ſake, as a firm Index and teſtimony of his reall intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; This kept him off from cloſing with his Parliament, and the rather becauſe they inſiſted to have the Sword in their power for ſo many years, or during his life; tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of him cauſed the Parliament to venture far; for it could not by this ſole defenſive way, but protract the war, diſcourage the ſouldier, and in fine ruine them, giving the King time to raiſe new forces at all times, if they could not gain his perſon; and this experience taught them ſo, that after many cumbats, their Armies ſtreighted and broken in great part, their full purſes being profuſely clean emptied; for who being an Engliſh man did they think would have oppoſed the power of the Nation for a ſole perſons ſake? but by the juſt hand of God, and to bring to puniſhment ſuch offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as the legal ſword would never reach, he inclines mens hearts to follow the King, moſt of them yet Papiſts or meer formal Proteſtants and debaucht ones; the generality of the ſo called Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy eſpecially all in honor, or that bowed to that Idol; among them were alſo many men of very tender conſcience, zealous of truth, and performing (at leaſt to men) righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide were at firſt all the vulgar, all men generally eying God in his wayes of providence, poor deſpicable creatures, yet full of faith and knowledge; theſe were of ſeveral opinions concerning God, his Names, Attributes, Eſſence, our Saviour, the holy Spirit, his ſervice, their own duty, publike and private, that is, their duty to God, and one to another.</p>
                  <p>But two eſpecially were powerful in adherents, The one called the Presbyterian, the other the Independent; the main differences twixt which I ſhall, as far as I can here, ſuccinctly lay down, not upon their nice critical diſtinctions as Schollars ſo called, but in the plain way of rational difference. Now truly I ſee no difference as to the points of faith; they acknowledge both the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt, the end of the Sons miſſion, to offer ſalvation to all, but effect it onely to thoſe believe on him, whom he hath elected before the world began, in due time calls, and at laſt ſaves, not for their

                  <p>They indeed ſeem to differ about obedience to what Law; the Presbyterian having ſtill an eye to the at leaſt equity of the Judicials; but I preſume if throughly examined, eaſie to be reconciled: Their main differences then one would think might be eaſily determined, but they are thought vaſt and irreconcileable, and they are theſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, whether an outward and viſible ſucceſſion derivative, not onely from the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, but alſo from their calling, ſo ſuppoſed, is of neceſſity to the true Church, which is really the ſame difference betwixt the Presbyterian and Biſhop, and Biſhop and Papiſt; the Papiſt urging it againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> reforming Biſhop, and ſo the Biſhop againſt the preſent Reforming Presbyterian, and the Presbyterian a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Independent ſo called; now the plain Queſtion hath this involved difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in it, as I conceive;</p>
                  <p>That is, what neceſſity of impoſition of Hands? for if it doth confer Grace, an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike vertue being tyed to the Succeſſors of Biſhops, Prieſts, Deacons upon that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſt, <hi>What ever ye bind on earth,</hi> &amp;c. or <hi>I will be with you to the end of the world;</hi> or incluſively from the effect of impoſition, That they receive the holy Ghoſt; then it is of neceſſity; but if it be but declarative of the deſignation of the perſon to the office of the Miniſtery, then it is not of neceſſity, unleſs ſpecially commanded, which wil alſo here ſhortly determine the buſineſs of Confimation of Infants, which may ſeem to have war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thus far in Chriſtian Congregations, That men and women baptized Infants, and after they come to age, walking blameleſly, may and ought openly before the admiſſion to the Ordinance of the Lords Supper, be examined by the Paſtor, the Congregation, or ſuch as will preſent, concerning the hope of their ſalvation, which allowed to pray for the bleſſings of the Lord upon them, and to confirm and ſtrengthen them in this faith, I believe is, and will be acknowledged, and duly practiſed in covenient time.</p>
                  <p>And laſt, and in chief the Independent hold forth the particular Rights of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregations; that is, each Congregation is ſubject to no other head but Chriſt in the things of Chriſt; that is, to govern it ſelf according to the Scripture, without any ſuperintendencie of one or more perſons, or Churches ſo called, that is, Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>The Presbyterian differs upon this, as holding forth no order, but introductive of an abſolute confuſion: Now the reaſon of this high judgement, is indeed upon very high conſequences, which rather the practiſes then the principles of the Independents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare: for let the Presbyterian ſpeak out, and he ſaith, the Independent razes the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Church Government ſeveral ways; and to profeſs the truth, their Tenents tend to thus much and no more, nor otherwiſe deſtroying Government or order;</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Rome</hi> is Myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> literally; That all the Nations, Provinces, and Kingdoms who partake of the fornication of that ſpiritual Whore, that is, walk upon her ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, ſhall partake with her in her plagues; that this Cup which is in her hand, all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, at leaſt called Chriſtian, have drunk deep of; That the ſo called Miniſtry of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> holding no Call but the outward, or that principally, and this derived from, or by the corrupted Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> is no true Miniſtry, or at leaſt not the true Miniſtry; That neither are the ſo called Lords Biſhops, nor the domineering Claſſis of Elders, whether Parochial or Provincial, the officers of the Church, warranted in Scripture for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of Paſtoral duty or ability, That reſting in the whole Church, or community of believers gathered into Congregations; That all of them being corrupted, nay, loſt both in Doctrine and Diſcipline, are to be gathered anew; all that are in the Pariſhes, though holding forth the profeſſion of Chriſt, yet walking clean contrary, are not by the power of Baptiſm, or that Covenant (implicite, that is, being bound not by their own words, but the confeſſion and ingagements of others) abſolutely in the Church, and ſo to have right to the Ordinances of the laſt Supper; but that before they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they ought to give ſatisfaction to the Church (that is, that company of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to which they ſhall joyn themſelves) of their faith, and the hope they have of their ſalvation, and walking accordingly; and theſe are hence (juſtly) called thoſe of the Congregational way, commonly called Independents.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the Presbyterian holds the ſame with the Biſhop in every point, onely the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105181:40"/> perſon of the Biſhop, as the Head or Angel of the Church, is he in whom, ſaith the Biſhop, the power of the Church ſpecially reſts, and the great truſts of Ordination, and Confirmation, and ſo Excommunication.</p>
                  <p>The Presbyterians ſay in the Elderſhip.</p>
                  <p>The Independent in the whole Congregation.</p>
                  <p>It is truth, theſe things were and are otherwiſe received by the vulgar and multitude: The Independent ſo called, being burthened, both by Biſhop and Presbyterian with all calumnies; as the Presbyterian being envied much by the Biſhop, being as his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and by all their followers; and that juſt as the Papiſts had in the firſt Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion branded the Church ſo called of <hi>England,</hi> governed by Biſhops, but denying the Supremacy of the Pope, and therefore curſed by them as Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Adulterers, yea Heathens; for by their rule we had no Miniſtry, no Sacraments, and ſo conſequently no Church, becauſe not holding of their head the Pope.</p>
                  <p>And in the word of a Chriſtian, ſo doth the conſequence of the Epiſcopal and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Doctrine brand the Congregational way; for they ſay, no Miniſtry but ſo derived as by Succeſsion from the Apoſtles; and that admitted, they muſt hold none have power to adminiſter the Sacraments. They all differ alſo about Government in the Church; the Biſhop and Presbyterian much what alike, both indeed making the officers of the Church the Church, as <hi>Rome</hi> doth; ſo as the Church taking the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſolely into themſelves, count all other Chriſtians as Lay-men; they had as good ſay Heathens; if throughly ſcanned, and they onely the Clergy, the Prieſts of the living God, &amp; ſo indeed claim a magiſterial power by the ſame Rules, Order, Arguments, and Diſtinctions and Differences, as <hi>Rome</hi> doth, yea, over the Supream Magiſtrate, making him their rod of iron to threſh the Nations, that is, all oppoſers of their Claſsical Edicts: Theſe men gave the Magiſtrate no more power then the Pope; for as he, ſo they were the Church, the holy ones, the Saints, at leaſt repreſentative.</p>
                  <p>To theſe, men at firſt gave great regard; but many wiſe Heathen Lay-men feared theſe mens unskilful lording it over the Lords Inheritance; for they preſumed theſe raſh Novices in civil Diſcipline would drive higher then the Biſhops, who had gone before them; Surely, if the Biſhops, men trained up at the Courts of Princes, after they came out of the Halls of Lords (for the Chaplains of great men came generally to Epiſcopal Thrones or Chairs) and ſo had ſtill had a reflection upon the order of civil Government, and had undoubtedly improved their natural, as well as ſo called ſpiritual Talent, if they had loſt themſelves, and ruined Government, through error in Judgement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or dependance: what would theſe who came but from the Pedantical Tyranny of the Univerſities, and fooliſh idiotiſms of <hi>puer-putes?</hi> I intend this to meer Scholars, and give them but their own language, which I preſume they cannot but apprehend.</p>
                  <p>Theſe conſiderations made the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> while yet unſhattered otherwiſe then by defection (baſe unworthy defection! they ſhould as men have had reſolutions worthy their truſts; but their cauſe, it ſeems, gave no courage at firſt) to declare againſt theſe powers of Pariſhional Presbyteries to this effect, that they did not intend to raiſe nine thouſand odd hundred Seats of Judgement, or Judicatories; that is, ſo many as there were Pariſhes of <hi>England;</hi> the leaſt of which ſhould have more power then the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I think few men knowing but will agree, that the name onely of Biſhop ſhould have been ſuſpended or extinguiſhed, but the ſame power, yea, that ſo called by the Presbyter unjuſt, being exerciſed by the Biſhop, the preheminence being now in the Presbytery, the ſame had been allowed; and indeed it pleaſed God ſo farto give way, that theſe men were throughly tryed; for the Parliament did (not ſeeing all at once) conſtitute Elderſhips to be choſen, and improved ſome men, whether intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as ſuppoſing that Diſcipline beſt, or ſo called, politickly to diſcover their temper, I determine not.</p>
                  <p>But theſe men preſently fall hot upon the work, and what had but juſt before ruined their predeceſſors the Biſhops, and been their ſtumbling ſtone, namely the Non-Conformity of the now called Presbyter, becomes the Presbyters rock of offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſo now called Independents: And to aſſure this, after the manner of the Apoſtate Church, they call for the ſecular power (or the power of the ſecular Sword) and an Act was ſaid to be prepared, they talked much of it.</p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:105181:40"/>
                  <p>That Non-Conformiſts ſhould have a liberty to bear office, either in Church or Commonwealth: It is truth, the rigidity of ſome its probable, ſeeking not onely the Supremacy of power, but an addition of wealth, for by them alſo were ſought outward honor, riches, Lay-power ſo called, and what elſe was of the old Babels traſh to adorn the Church, and by them called the Churches Rights, bounding it to the ſo called Prieſthood, was by theſe as much eyed as by the verieſt <hi>Babylonian</hi> in the world, and the Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> ſtill made the Stalking-horſe to their lucre; and the baſe men of a rout of people, ſo called alſo <hi>Cleri</hi> or Clergy men, in whom, if St. <hi>Paul</hi> left the Qualifications right ſet down, were rather the Prieſts of <hi>Bacchanals</hi> if not of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> then Paſtors of rightly conſtituted Congregations; and theſe altogether take advantage of an Ordinance made for Tythes to give the denied treble damages; they alſo upon the ſame grounds, get Acts, Orders or Ordinances for uniting Pariſhes, and could inform untruths for advantage, which appearing, the union is for malice, not conſcience of the complainer diſſolved; for could the perſecutor have had his Tythes but for half value, all had been whiſt, but the Prieſt ſaw not where ſuch agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would reſt; he might undo the Church, that is, his Succeſſor by that means.</p>
                  <p>Wills Probation fixed as they were under an incertain irregular way and illegal, till eſtabliſhed; they continued the Marriage of perſons (as a Sacrament) to be the proper work of the Prieſts; Baptizing Infants the eighth day, held, if not by the wiſeſt, yet by the moſt, of neceſſity to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Yea, ſome held, That the Sacrament of the Lords Supper was a converting Ordinance, and ſo to be adminiſtred to all to whom the Goſpel was to be preached, namely the moſt prophane of any.</p>
                  <p>This to many ſeemed rather an allowance Politick, then Religious, to gain a party then to give forth a principle, untill ſome leaders were found publickly to avow the Tenent; but this licentiouſneſs loſt them the beſt and moſt conſiderable party. I ſhall not further wade in theſe Controverſies, nor had I gone thus far, could I have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes well cleared what is to follow;</p>
                  <p>Namely, that the Magiſtrate eyed theſe Tenets, as ſorting with or againſt his intereſt, and accordingly ſeemed to allow or diſallow; The Presbyter ſtruck ſo high at the root of Magiſtracy, making them their meer Executioners, and bringing by Text of old Law what was given to the Prieſts more imperiouſly into the <hi>Cleri;</hi> and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, the ſo called <hi>Eraſtian,</hi> giving all to the Magiſtrate, not as of the Church, or in the Church, but meerly from the Civil Juriſdiction, and totall ſubjection of the whole courſe of ſo called Prieſts unto the meer will of the Magiſtrate, either by doing or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, not allowing an equitable diſpute, as both were thought beſt to be at preſent rejected.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſo called Independent, or rather Congregational party, walking in the mean, what ever the vulgar eſteemed them, and how Idiot-like and ſimply they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of them; yet the moderate and inquiſitive found in their Doctrine, more of the purity and ſimplicity of the Doctrine of Chriſt, then either of the other held forth; namely, Biſhop or Presbyter: yea, no ſuch infallibility by them pretended to, as both the other were guilty of, theſe holding that though there was all the revealed Will of God manifeſted in the Scriptures, yet that all was not diſcovered to the world, much leſs received by it all at once; but that the Wiſdom of God unveiled himſelf, and gave out to every Age their portion.</p>
                  <p>The Examples they gave were clear as day, in the great manifeſtations God had given the world in theſe latter times from <hi>Luther</hi> to his followers, from them to <hi>Calvin,</hi> from him to this preſent; and therefore they propounded, That the Rule of Gods Word held forth many things that to this Age ſeemed clear, yet a future might deſcry doubts in, &amp; therefore they adviſed moderation to be uſed towards men of all opinions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning matters of Religion of all ſorts, and ſo held forth the propoſition of liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but not as agreeing that each man might do what him luſt, or live at his own law.</p>
                  <p>But that as no man knew the Father, but he to whom the Son revealed him, nor the Son but by the Father, that is, the communication of the work of grace was ſolely from the immediate hand of the Almighty; That man not diſobeying the Law Civil, that is, the proper Law of the Magiſtrate, as man, That the Civil Sword or Sword of Civil Juſtice reached not the life of any man, no not his eſtate, that is, had no juſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over a man for what was only meer matter of religion, that is of pure conſcience;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105181:41"/> That is, to ſpeak to the moſt mens underſtanding, that the Magiſtrate was not (at leaſt ſo the Keeper of both Tables, as) to enforce an outward obedience to the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion he held forth; the preſident of error manifeſt was in the divers ſounds of the Trumpets of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth, James</hi> and <hi>Charls,</hi> all various, ſome contrary; this ſummed up drew from contrary affected ones, whether from intereſt, evil affection, or ignorance, two charges.</p>
                  <p>One of confuſion ſo called, by affecting toleration for all opinions, yea even to community of wives and eſtates, afterwards called Levelling.</p>
                  <p>The other of new Lights, as if they had been meerly ſceptical, that is, ready every hour, at every change of intereſt, or whimſey of the crown, by a prophetick phantaſy to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a change of at leaſt religious principles.</p>
                  <p>I have been in company with them, who after bitter invectives againſt Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents (yea I may atteſt ſome of the black cloath) have upon the opening of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, approved their enemies, and diſallowed their own parties, profeſſing to have taken up the controverſie but on truſt; however the opinion of the ſo called Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent agreed with the temper of the civil Magiſtrate, as by him thought moſt ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yet not of neceſſity to the power by them intended, which was regulated De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracie, as the King held Epiſcopacy beſt, as moſt ſutable to Monarchy; and the Presbyterian affected the (Lords) (however degenerated) as ſorting beſt with Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracie now corrupted: Now theſe parties, though they held forth principles diverſe, yea ſome ſeemingly contrary, while the power of the King was on foot, yet they fell not right out; many Independents looking at the outward letter of the Covenant took it; ſome fearing, denyed it; but this bred hot diſputes, and though it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as aforeſaid, as a meer civil touchſtone for the Commonwealths ſettlement, yet from the different Intereſt of parties it was diſobliged; but eſpecially after the ſence was explained; and that ſo far from the pure natural acception of the letter, for inſtance, that clauſe to labour uniformity, &amp;c, according to the Word of God, and the example of the beſt Reformed Churches, which was interpreted of <hi>Scotland</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally by the party.</p>
                  <p>This being on foot, and the Parliaments party brought low under the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Defenſive General; The Parliament had now found out a man, I may ſay God ſent them one, though of Noble extraction in the worlds phraſe, that is, born of rich parents, yea anciently rich, who would take an Offenſive Commiſsion; for it is ſaid <hi>Eſſex</hi> would not; the Commons were eager, but the Lords oppoſed this, by this time reſenting, their Intereſt alſo hung upon the ſame chain with the Kings; but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking was proceeded in too far to be ſtopped, ſo that on they go, and now in a miſerable low condition, they reſolve to new mould the Army, a work ſo improper and impertinent, both in regard of diſtaſting old Commanders, and getting new mutinies of old Souldiers, not willing to change a General until all ſcores be cleared, as well as getting new, when on the loſing, nay loſt ſide, and that obſtructed with ſtain of Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>But all theſe bugs paſt aſide, it is ordered, and accordingly done; but there is a rub caſt in the way by the brethren of <hi>Scotlands</hi> friends; for it is ordered none to bear office in the Army that ſhould not take the Covenant; yet this all this while held forth as a religious Oath, a Covenant to God, and from thence urged to the end of civil ſettlement; and at laſt it went ſo high, that no one ſhould bear Office Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick ſo called, Civil, or Military, that would not ſubject his conſcience to this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which as I have ſaid few men literally oppoſed, but obſtructed with the late <hi>Scottiſh</hi> miſt of interpretation or explanation but as occaſion offered; this alſo was not ſo preſſed as to retard the work which now preſſed hard upon them; ſo that it was reported divers of the Members thought the Seats at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> too hot; for <hi>Leiceſter</hi> taken, and the King with his Army coming on full and ſtrong, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's weak and thin, all was counted loſt: I my ſelf the day the field of <hi>Naſeby</hi> was fought, dined with four of the Honors ſo called, of Knight-Baronets, and two Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels under the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> who avowed there were but two Souldiers in the Field, the General, and Major General; <hi>Cromwel</hi> was known abſent, and the outlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Gameſter <hi>Vermuden</hi> gone, when tide turned, he had lately laid down; which made them ſay, had they one thouſand pound, they would not be in the Battaile for nine hundred, ſo loſt was the Cauſe given; yet a Noble Knight, though highly affected to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105181:41"/> the Intereſt both of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Mancheſter</hi> reſolved, he had rather loſe his 1000. l. there, then have it, and life, and liberty taken away.</p>
                  <p>To this deſpicable Army in ſuch a ſeaſon and juncture of time, as there never was the like for ſtrength of all ſorts on the other ſide, (as in all Battails before) after a loſs of the day in the wiſdom and power of mans ſtrength) did the Lord give ſuch a ſignall Victory, as being wiſely followed and improved, the Kings party were never able to make head again; but their ſeverall parties in the ſeverall Counties, were, partly by the <hi>Scot,</hi> keeping them on work by diverſions; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Generall, neither Winter nor Summer gave any ſtop, till <hi>England</hi> had but two Armies, the mercinary ſo called of <hi>Scots,</hi> and the other of <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the King, <hi>Oxford</hi> now only left unto him, was enforced to try his then laſt ſhift, namely to betake himſelf to the <hi>Scot,</hi> having a ſtrong Army before <hi>Newark,</hi> thereby to engage a quarrel, as is more then evident to all; by whom he is preſently upon the ſurrender of the place, carried back to <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> and they wiſely finding the difficulties attending them, in caſe they ſhould carry him perſonally into <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon a Treaty deliver him up to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and what was altogether unexpected, return into their own Land, what engagements to a return I know not: And now the Presbyterian party ſo called, fly high indeed, and urge execution to the higheſt of the ſettlement of their own Intereſt, &amp; having no other publick enemy, bandy againſt their brethren in the Lords War; the generality of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> was for them; the ſo called Independents, being eſteemed by the many, as the Chriſtians of old, actors of all impurities, and their fry of Confederates the Sectaries, but as ſo many legions of Divels, ſent into the world to give a ſtop to the erection of the glorious Kingdom of the Lord Chriſt Jeſus; and ſure ſome in their zeal would have thought they had done God good ſervice to have killed them.</p>
                  <p>I can in my private thoughts compare their condition to none better, then that of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they had the Sea before them, and an Army behind them, and were in the wilderneſs; I know the paſſion of many a ſoul, when after all their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails for Liberty, from the yoak ſo called of the Biſhops Tyranny, they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ground to powder under the Milſtone of the Presbyters Rigidity, and all this for conſcience ſake; for the Presbyter began according to the old Rule with Church work, and that was and ever will be long work; eſpecially where men take it upon them without the Lord, the builder builds in vain.</p>
                  <p>From this the Commonwealth being ſtill as over-burthened as before, the diſtaſtes were great againſt the preſent Governors; ſtill as before the galled back ſeeks eaſe, let the plaiſter, cover, or ſaddle be not only gilt, but gold; This opens a way to the oppreſſed for the righteous and juſt ends of the undertaking of this war being held forth, that the ends of the Covenant, as looking at Gods glory, the peoples good, and the juſt Rights of the King were not ever intended to be denyed; but the pretended ends, namely thereby to enſnare the conſciences of men by ſelf-ended gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or the baniſhing their perſons, and confiſcation of their goods, not for neglect of civil obedience, but not conforming to the opinion of others, when as yet it was profeſſed, that grace was the free gift of God, that the rules of prudence or earnall policy had no ground in Gods Word; if prudence only might rule, why not the Popes and Biſhops as well as the Presbyters? and to enforce conſcience with the Sword of the <hi>Scot</hi> was as evil as the Mace of a <hi>German.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe and the like matters diſperſed abroad, and eſpecially in the Army, ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments rowze, and head, and notwithſtanding all poſsible endeavors of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both at <hi>London</hi> and in the Counties, the whole Army is fixed, and both with life and Armes meet at the Rendezvouz, and engage to proſecute the juſt ends of Liberty, or to obtain the juſt Liberty of the people (and hereabout the name of Levellers firſt aroſe) part of the Army actually ſeize the Kings perſon at <hi>Holmby,</hi> and now the active Grandees of the ruling party, ſo called Presbyterian, are accuſed of high Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>The King is under the cuſtody of the Army, and all means endeavoured, I beleeve, to make him inſtrumentall to the ends propounded to themſelves; how far their Treaty proceeded, or what obligations were on either ſide, were and are to me pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; I can take them to be but politick Tranſactions with reſpects to their mutuall
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105181:42"/> reſpective or particular Intereſts; and no further carried on, but that either party had their ſafeguard, their way and place of retreat.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, there was much ſpoken now of the <hi>Scots</hi> return, and many agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a great body was enforced to attend the King: And he of a politique head was much catching and drawing; and it is likely that his great knowledge, where he met with true conſcience, not equally gifted, he muſt prevail; for prevention of which and other evils, he I beleeve by ſtratagem and over-reach, was brought to carry himſelf into the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> where five hundred could do more then ten thouſand otherwhere; but ſee, this brings greater preplexities; for many now wearied with war, and its effects of all ſorts, or ſo pretending, taking advantage of the Armies op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of disbanding, cry out, there can be no peace while there is an Army; and though it is truth they were not a meer mercinary Army, but raiſed by Parliament, under the notion of engagement, as free men, for their own juſt Rights: Yet it was plain their Intereſt was now grown wholly into the Army, and that experience ſhewed there could be no juſt ſettlement while the Sword was unſheathed, That they intended nothing but to take away property, and introduce confuſion, and were Levellers, haters of all Juſtice; ſo that now the Souldier was enforced to ſtand upon his own guard; <hi>London</hi> was oppoſite, her Trade was decayed, her Aſſeſsments great, and all places filled with complaints; The weaker party in Parliament being ſedulous and crying up the Common good, got not only many hearts, but had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven many ſtrong dependants into principal places of Truſt and Office, both at Sea and Land; ſo that all that the mighty men could do, was only to plot, but they could not bring to effect: The Army was before much admired for complying with the King; and who ſo high againſt them as the Presbyter? O they treated, indeed it was the ſucceſs (however carried) they maligned; ſure I am, they oppoſed not the thing, for they acted higher in it, then ever did the other; but to prepare for the work about the eleventh of <hi>June,</hi> 1647.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>London Apprentices</hi> ſo called, made the fouleſt breach unto the Liberty of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> that ever was, forcing away the Speaker, and all partaking with the Intereſt of the Army; and the reſidue of the Members to teſtifie their contrivance of the fact, chooſe a new Speaker; and declare them at <hi>Windſor,</hi> the head-Quarters of the Army, whither the Speaker and divers Parliament men were fled, or retired, a meer <hi>Juncto</hi> (as the Parliament of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the Aſſembly at <hi>Oxford</hi> had before mutually declared againſt each other) But by the power of the Army they are re-inſtated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and declare <hi>Pelhams</hi> Parliament ſo called, he being the new choſen Speaker, no Parliament; but the lenity of the prevailing part went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then impriſonment of ſome heads, either not daring in ſuch a difficult ſeaſon, or prudently forbearing to exaſperate; but this lenity ſhattered much their work; for although in the re-inſtating theſe Members, the Army paſſing through the heart of <hi>London,</hi> ſhewed themſelves brethren, not enemies; no force, no diſdain appearing; yet <hi>London</hi> was full of hot humours; and no ſooner was the body of the Army to that end politickly diſperſed, by the Members kept in, by every Voting, but they break forth anew.</p>
                  <p>Yea, ſo was the plot laid, that each County in <hi>England</hi> ſhould have their embroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the <hi>Scot</hi> ſhould return to beat down the Levelling Army, and re-inthrone the Presbyter; but declared to make way for a free Treaty with the King at the Iſle of <hi>Wight;</hi> a ſure plot; for the Army every where diſtracted, what could they do? But the plot works, let us ſee the event; <hi>Wales</hi> begins, the remote part Weſt; thither is <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſent; He gone, all on the ſudden the world is full, but happily by degrees, not as intended, but occaſionally; each party of Rogues, who began the work, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves able to re-inſtate King <hi>Charls;</hi> the next place was <hi>Norwich,</hi> where the Lord ſhewed himſelf wonderfully, both in the height of power, and depth of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, of which only one word.</p>
                  <p>There was about two thouſand perſons in ſix hours time gathered together, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended untill <hi>May</hi> day, the choyce day of the Major by promiſcuous popular Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (I need ſay no more to ſhew the evil in caſe of a future ſettlement) but the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor being upon miſcarriage ſent for by a Meſſenger of Parliament; to kill the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and reſcue the Major, this multitude pretended to riſe; but up, they broke open
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105181:42"/> one of the Sheriffs houſes, and rifled the ſame, and the Exciſe Office, and then ſeized the Magazine of the County, in which was ninety eight barrels of powder; there were in the houſe, dwellers to the number of twenty and odd of men, women, and children; the houſe was large and ſtrong, yet they forced it open, there being Arms alſo for two thouſand perſons; which found out, they preſently arm and charge; but the ſcowrers and worms being in, and they in haſte, their Guns became uſeleſs againſt the Horſe, who came in to the aſſiſtance of the Roundheads, as they were called, of whom it was reſolved, not one ſhould be left alive by the next day after. And now both Presbyter and Independent being in the ſame danger, they both met as friends, and accounted the ones ſafety the others preſervation; and as God preſerved the Souldier without, ſo did he alſo them within the houſe; for the houſe being blown up, as is moſt likely by wilfulneſs of ſome of them (for it was declared the day before, it would be blown up) and above one hundred of them found dead, not one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants were ſlain, though under the ſame ruines; yea, a woman great with childe, formerly ſubject to miſcarry, now near her time, though lying long under a great wall, was taken out ſafe, miſcarried not, but liveth ſtill to praiſe the Lord, with thoſe her brethren and ſiſters, who ſaw themſelves in the grave, and were yet raiſed; and this was done, <hi>April</hi> the twenty fourth, One thouſand ſix hundred forty eight.</p>
                  <p>From hence were the Souldiers, while the City was yet ſcarce ſetled, called to <hi>Bury</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> thence into <hi>Kent,</hi> thence to <hi>Colcheſter;</hi> a ſmall party brought <hi>Holland's</hi> and <hi>Buckingham's</hi> partakers to their ſhame; and the <hi>Scot,</hi> before not known whether Royal or Presbyterial, being (with much ado) diſowned by the Parliament, by reaſon, as was declared, of the inſufferable cruelties and rapines by them exerciſed upon the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but the viſible intereſt of them was wholly Royal, commixing Councels and Intereſt with the renegate <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo called; and although all the breakings forth were meerly by the looſe multitude, and no appearance but for the Royal party; yet this hint was taken, ſtrongly to urge a cloſe with his Majeſty; and to make this the leſs doubtfull, the Navy in great part revolt, and the ſtrong ſupporters of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian party engage in it.</p>
                  <p>Now whether the Independents were not true to the King in their Colloque, I here quaere not, nor can more then before; This I am ſure, they were true to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But the Presbyterian party ſo called, were not true to themſelves; for the King out-went them as far as the other did him; not that I beleeve that they intended it, but that their Leaders now ſeeing things at a dead lift, reſolved to make the beſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain they could for themſelves, not ſeeking the Kings Intereſt neither, but as it ſtood with their own; therefore they reſolve to pleaſe the King in all; and that the Treaty might be free, ſend him down new Suits &amp;c. and free him from the cloſe impriſonment or reſtraint wherein he had ſuffered; and this proceeded to a large Treaty, wherein the King and his Creatures treated all matters as them liſted; and that which was never heard on in the world, a Prince alone to maintain Arguments both divine and civil againſt the utmoſt wits of Lawyers and Divines, and as they were printed, ſeemed to ſurmount them; yet to get himſelf into the Throne, and make his enemies bowe, he parted with what he had argued himſelf into; ſo they had what they had, not of right, but grant ſtill; and all this done with ſuch ſobriety, ſuch oppoſition, granting now a little, then a little, that a meer honeſt eye-witneſs would have been deceived, notwithſtanding he knew his Majeſty had declared himſelf a priſoner, not free, his Son the Prince now acting by his command, avowing the Treaty forced, and the Armies of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> engaged to break all off.</p>
                  <p>But God, notwithſtanding all this, that breaks all the bows that were ſtrained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, ſcatters all theſe clouds; only <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, and the Fleet are continued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o exerciſe our patience; during the ſiege of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> it is wonderfull that the poor Souldier ſhould endure to fight the ſame men ſo many times, ſtill ſending them to <hi>London,</hi> whence they eſcaped, and yet he not execute them, but ſend them again; ſo that I have heard ſome were taken above ſeven times priſoners; the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſeemed to fight againſt them, or bewaile the obdurateneſs of ſome hearts, by a continual rain during all that ſummer, eſpecially at that ſiege, which though long, yet at laſt was effected; And God ſo bleſſed the Lieut, General in the North, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105181:43"/> though he had been made ſpecially inſtrumentall in moſt the great warlike affairs (as well as conciliary) yet here he triumphed indeed; the General taken priſoner, and the whole Army utterly diſſipated, though above three to one, and diſputed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; but who can oppoſe the will of the Almighty.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſome endeavoured therein ſtill, and theſe ſucceſſes againſt him whom God would caſt down, engaged them the more ſpeedily to effect their intentions, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act a disbanding of the Army, leſt the Army ſhould disband them; This haſtens the Armies march to <hi>London,</hi> I am conſident altogether unreſolved what to do; the work which God now called them to, was higher then ever, and the preſages were the ruine either of <hi>London,</hi> the Army, or both; certainly there were many who would have put it to the Tryal; but the Citizens wiſely conſidering, that the multitude of diſcontented perſons, poor and neceſſitous, were as great, if not greater dangers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, then the Army without, and that loſe they what they could by compliance, they muſt loſe more by oppoſition, they admit the General.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament is now ſhattered, many of the Members being taken and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are declared as guilty of the bringing in the <hi>Scots,</hi> and might as well, if not better, of the ſeveral mutinies in <hi>England</hi> on the Land, and defection of the Ships at Sea; <hi>London</hi> is now Garriſoned, the Arrears which were great there (intending by want of pay, if poſſible, to diſhearten the Souldier) are ſtrictly ordered, (and the Seat of the beaſt there, that is <hi>Pauls</hi> Church the Cathedral made a Court of Guard) and ſuch Members as would avow the proceedings with the King, excluded the Houſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ireland</hi> all this while was to the Parliament almoſt, as it hath been with me, a thing not regarded; but now there are thoughts of that, and the Army ſetled under a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number, with a ſettlement of pay reſpectively, and order taken for the ſettling the Navy, and Generals ſent forth; there is great thoughts of the neceſſity of doing Juſtice; mens minds had run no higher generally, then happily to bring a Lord or two to the block; but lo, God raiſeth mens ſpirits to that height, and brings them to it by degrees, that they bring even the King himſelf to the Barr of Juſtice; O that every heart may tremble at the work of the Lord! he hath here manifeſted his power, let all Princes tremble; <hi>Charls</hi> of <hi>England</hi> the beſt of Kings, I may admit, but the worſt of all other men (for none hath ſuch obligations) is the example.</p>
                  <p>No Nation had the like mercies with <hi>England,</hi> the hand of heaven had planted and watered us, we were grown rich, our eyes ſtared with fat, and our bodies ſweat under the pride of apparel; but our Religion was formal, and all our improvement of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mercies were to licentiouſneſs; the poor were naked, idle, and unprovided for; the Law held forth righteouſneſs, but the Judges and Miniſters made it crooked, or broken; the rich men only were imployed, the honour of Magiſtracy was rich clothes and a full Table, but they were too good to take pains.</p>
                  <p>Now O all you Magiſtrates, ſee, God hath plucked him out, who was prayed for as the light of your life, and the breath of your noſthrils, the fountain of your ſo called Honours, your Idoll; and hath broken off, not only the palms of his hands and his feet, but by the Sword of the Lord hath cut off his head, as an offender againſt the Laws, which he was entruſted to be the chief Keeper of. I write it, when I ſtill ſee with grief, men great in riches, able in parts, think ſcorn to be left out of Offices and places of truſt, as neglected; but put them in, and if they have nothing elſe to do, they think that a work below them: I avow it juſt, if God ſhould turn them out of all, and ſet the Plough-man to be their Lord; but I ſee yet no Juſtice for man to do it; yet that they ſhould be puniſhed, is moſt juſt; but of this more ſeaſonably afterwards; men that will may ſee God in this, and admire.</p>
                  <p>I know many pious Chriſtians, enemies to this Act, who yet adhered to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all the Wars, and contributions thereto, againſt the King, yea in the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive one; but their ſtick is the Covenant; I would have ſuch reſt content <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <p>That party of Parliament who tranſacted the affairs of State, now ſtill keeping the name of the Parliament (though aſſiſted with, or guarded by the Army) and in that ſaving to us our due Rights and Liberties, of equal Law and property, After this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Sentence proceeds to the ſentencing of others, both of high and low eſtate, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105181:43"/> enact the alteration of the State of the Nation from a Monarchy, the Government being grown wholly confuſed; the due regulation of the Prince, the priviledges of Parliament, and the liberty of the Subject, being rather not to be diſtinguiſhed then deſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; rather treated on in the Schools then by themſelves; and our Laws (though the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them excuſed no man) by the Judges or Senate, then by the many concerned, whether Executioners as Juſtices of the Peace, inferior Judges, Conſtables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or the poor multitude; yea, all our Cities and Boroughs loſt in their Franchiſes, and Towns lawleſs in all kinds, ſo that there was a kinde of legall levelling or theevery grown common: Was it not high time for the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> to ſtep up? God raiſed up ſome ſpirits, and but a few, they attempted high matters, feared not the frown of a King, nor the combinations of all neighbour Princes, which was threatned, but reſolved to eſtabliſh the work God ſet them about: And I let them to know God hath plained the way unto them, there is no oppoſition but Self; they have been Gods inſtruments for great works, and muſt be yet for greater; ſucceſs doth not always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the truth, God may ſuffer them in many errors for one good ſake; What he intends I determine not, but may conjecture, that themſelves ſaw God Almighty intended an alteration of that frame of Government which was in this Nation. What to ſettle is their work, and how; to oppoſe this ſettlement was now the endeavour; ſome things I fear in the many Counterbuffs which God had given, were taken to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which were never ſo intended, though they might be tendered inopportunely, and under the time of the grand deſign of Petitioning:</p>
                  <p>As namely ſome Petitions, which though not burned by the hands of the Hangman, as that was preſented to the ungarbled Houſe, yet it was for ſome things, (it may be juſtly diſtaſted) in the whole diſowned, and called, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſcalled as ſeditious by ſome intereſſed perſons, to render the whole odious. <hi>Rainsborough</hi> is ſlain, and no due enquiry into his death, or Sir <hi>H. Cholmleys</hi> ſuppoſed compliance with the <hi>Pomfreteers:</hi> This in an unſetled State (where though faith was highly known and pretended to on both ſides, little was acted by the parties contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, but as men) adopted enemies to new attempts, and that from grounds given forth plauſible enough; for the Engagements at <hi>New-Market,</hi> and <hi>Triploe-Heath, &amp;c.</hi> were made the outſide of the deſign: The matter propoſed might be juſt, but the way of undertaking diſowned, and they ſoon quelled by the valour and policy of the Lieut. General, who had alſo with as much confidence, as cunning, ſtrangled it formerly at Ware.</p>
                  <p>How warrantable all proceedings were, I cannot at large here diſcuſs; but this is evident, as ſouldiers they could not ſo diſpute the matter, but their way was unjuſt; what ever their cauſe was as Subjects, they could but Petition, untill a lawful power or juſt neceſſity headed them: This awhile obſtructed the relief of <hi>Ireland,</hi> together with ſome ſcattered ſcrupling objections; as that the Land was theirs Originally, ours by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt onely, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Arguments admitted, would reduce us all to the mountain of <hi>Arrarat,</hi> and make all Nations fight there (if they could finde them) till they had the poſſeſſion which onely they could prove was the firſt indubitable rightful poſſeſſion of their firſt Anceſtor after the flood; not that I think it lawful for one Nation to diſpoſſeſs another at luſt; but poſſeſſion anciently acquired is juſt, till lawfully evicted; and if the conteſt be drawn to the Swords deciſion, it is at leaſt lawful on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors part.</p>
                  <p>But really what ever appeared in it, all theſe were but the ſtratagems of the defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed party of the King, to foment if poſsible new quarrels among the Parliament par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to give ſome new hopes to their dying, yea, dead-hearted cauſe, who meeting with diſcontented, hot, and eager ſpirits, were eaſily ſeduced; yea, ſo as to declare for the neceſsity of introducing the Son, when themſelves agreed to dethrone, nay, execute the Father; and ſo far may men be ſeduced by falſe intereſts: but ſome did highlier engage, declaring the Parliament no Parliament; and charging of ſome men eminently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental (to their own deſign) as abſolute Traytors; yea, higher then the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed. How things came to this height, is not worthy the controverting here; but this I muſt ſay, the Author was a man of a high ſpirit, and good natural parts, a great ſufferer for the common Cauſe, and promoter of it; but in ſtead of reward expected, ſleighted in what was acknowledged to him as duly merited; and upon miſtakes, as he avowed, impriſoned by his own party; thus highly exaſperated, he engages a ſtrong
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105181:44"/> party with him, who urging highly the failings of others, by opening errors, lay the ſeeds of new diviſions, as is objected againſt them; and he is upon this miſcalled, or called the Prince or Ring-leader of the ſo called Levellers, wherein I ſhall to clear all intereſts on foote, ſpeak a few words concerning Levelling; and that both properly and improperly, that is, both as it holds forth a juſt Rule, and is ſcandalized, and an unjuſt end, and therefore to be rejected; and the conteſt is but the ſame of Satans old way of malignity.</p>
                  <p>There are juſt things held out under the name of Levelling, which he would hide, and his inſtuments; therefore I beſeech all holding forth a profeſsion of Chriſtianity, to walk worthy of their high Calling to which they are called in the Lord Jeſus; not to expound, take, or receive things, matters or perſons into obloquie or honor for mens ſake, or becauſe of Intereſt ſake, but according to the rule of our holy profeſsion.</p>
                  <p>Levelling then may be conſidered, firſt, improperly, and ſo injuſtly, that is, for a forcible taking away the property of rich men, or men that have any property be it more or leſs: Now this is divers, as firſt, under colour of a Title, I take away the eſtate, whether reall or perſonal, of my neighbour, and will by no means come to, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſtore, or arbitrate the buſineſs; but knowing the Law (as now uſed) will afford a debate laſting, and a trick may overthrow (as aforeſaid) my neighbours juſt right; and if he be but poor or patient, he will be quickly diſheartened, and I ſhall gain my end, and injoy as juſtly, even by colour of Law, what was with deteſtable injury forced from another (this was the great beam in ſome mens eyes) and called legal Levelling, the moſt unjuſt of all, if truth it be ſo, which is much feared, being in all mens mouthes.</p>
                  <p>The next unjuſt Levelling was a Tenet, that the poor had an intereſt in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth as well as the rich; and that every man ought to have his portion; and that the great rich men having hoarded up the Treaſure, and joyning houſe to houſe, and field to field, they had ſo much care for the private, that the publike was neglected; yea, that the immoderate heaping of eſtate was unlawful, and that there ought to be a proportion above which no man might riſe; and to remedy theſe evils, they would have all eſtates caſt into a common ſtock, and the land (at leaſt) divided equally; and ſurely they had a great preſident in a famous Commonwealth, which twice (in a ſhort ſpace for ſuch a Revolution) or I am deceived, did ſuch an Act; but the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth was Heathen, and I know no Rule for us to walk by their example, unleſs the Word of God allow it.</p>
                  <p>The next unjuſt Levelling, is, by forcing not an equality of diviſion, but a perpetual community, as ſuppoſing all evils to grow principally from the infatiable thirſt after riches; therefore theſe propound, Not now to apportion eſtates, and after to ſettle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and admit buying &amp; ſelling, and tranſmutations of poſſeſſion, and ſo an alteration of the firſt ſettlement by degrees; but to veſt the whole intereſt in the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to ſettle allowances; firſt, for exceeding vertue, as Magiſtrates, and all for eminent excellencies imployed in publike truſt, according to their ſet and unalterably appointed degrees; and next for the multitude, according to a like ſet and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proportion, except by the publike Magiſtrate appointed, reſpect being duly had unto the number, and condition, of Age or Youth, and other qualifications, according to the plot laid down in that exquiſite piece of Sir <hi>Tho. Moore,</hi> intending, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of a Commonwealth, according to the rule of Nature, perfected by Evangelical Doctrine; and ſure it is, were ſuch a State from a voluntary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned deſire of well and righteous living, voluntarily eſtabliſhed, it were an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paradiſe; and that it is not impoſſible, the pattern of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> State over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming the moſt difficult parts of it, plainly declares; But its thought fit, not the powers onely, but the body are to be convinced of ſuch things moderately and wiſely, not by indiſcreet agitations, much leſs perturbations of a State, they are to be left to their judgements, God will effect aſſuredly ſuch things as he hath determined in his appointed ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Another Levelling here called unjuſt, that is, from error continued, or by force at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, as was objected, (ſome ſo pretending, being inſtrumental in renewing wars, and to cauſe out breakings) is in them, who were thought happily to ſettle or attempt the ſettlement of their own private frame of Commonwealth, by ſuch means; but truly, though ſome aſſiſt, and others more wiſe declare themſelves not willing to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105181:44"/> oppoſe, yet I hope, yea, and am verily perſwaded of ſome of them, they did both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, out of a tenderneſs to men whom they had known valiantly to oppoſe the common pretended Enemy, out of conſcience of the intereſt they now ſeemingly oppoſed, or at leaſt cleaved not unto, though they avowed they adhered to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt always pretended, but the men were changed, and acted not as they had declared.</p>
                  <p>Others were opinionated, that community was the Regiment of the Lord Jeſus; and that all Chriſtians ought to ſubmit to it; and they may ſay true, but that time may not be yet; and when it is, ſurely it will not be a confuſed community; the community among the Apoſtles (ſtretched only to voluntary ſales, and that) was, ſomewhat for the preſent neceſſity, but eſpecially and for ever to manifeſt they were all as one Family, under their Head the Lord Jeſus; and that no man called a Chriſtian, could call ought his own, while his faithful brother ſtood in need, which was, though not inforced, ever held by all Chriſtians, how ever weakly practiſed, and in the declining State of the Church, grew more obnoxious, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o evident neglect.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuch a community, that the poor Chriſtian being laborious (if able to work) ſhould be relieved where his labour failed, or in what it reached not unto (that ſo he might live comfortably, and rejoyce in the Covenant of his God) aſſuredly ought, and I hope will be reduced to its original purity.</p>
                  <p>Now there was another unjuſt Levelling talked of; which was an unregulated com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, that is, the ſetitng up the Law of Naturals without the Divine regulations; that is, to live like beaſts, to kill and eat, to live each man to his luſts, and the ſtronger to overcome the weaker; which confuſion having uſhered in a neceſſity of regulation, then and thereby to lay the foundations from that neceſsity, of a holy or juſt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity among the people; ſuppoſing men, while enjoying ought aſſuredly, would not be drawn to an unintereſted Politie, wherein, though the end be approved, yet no juſt man will allow the means, if he remember we muſt not do evil that good may come of it, no not in this juncture of time when the flood-gates of Liberty were broken up, though that ſome may think, to that end Providence ſo ordered the matter; and to men ſo ſettled, there is no chain ſtrong enough.</p>
                  <p>O Lord, I pray thee open ſuch eyes, eſpecially of thoſe that from a ſincere heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thy glory, leaſt their zeal, not according to knowledge, make thy truth and zeal for thee evil ſpoken of; and moſt like it is, of ſuch ſpirits were they, who were ſeduced, if ſeduced, or that they drew away themſelves and others with them.</p>
                  <p>But let them know, that in ſuch unruly breakings out of parties into contentions of divided intereſts, it is more lawful for their oppoſites, being in preſent power, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and puniſh them, then for them to labour and indeavour by force or diſobedience to ſubdue or caſhiere their oppoſites: And now I am come to the more particular diſcuſſion of juſt Levelling (or juſt things held out by men, no way aiming at any by, or corrupt end, or intereſt whatever.)</p>
                  <p>Juſt Levelling then ſo called is an impropriety in regard of the acceptance of the word, a propriety in regard of the end; for it looks at juſt things juſtly, however it is ſcandalized; and is in a word, but the rule of proportionate Juſtice: I ſay, not onely Juſtice, but proportionate, that is, that there be not onely one Law, but that Law held forth with due reſpects of equity and righteouſneſs; as for example, To charge a Gentleman that hath three hundred pound a year, a horſe for Service, and to charge him for 300. <hi>li.</hi> a year, to a Rate is juſt, for ſuch an eſtate there is; and to charge a Gentleman of three thouſand pound a year, a horſe alſo, is juſt; and to charge him for three thouſand pound <hi>per annum</hi> is juſt; but this is not levelled, that is, brought to the proportion of equal diſtributive Juſtice; for if you will do ſo, then the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt, and ought to be thus fixed; (firſt, admitting that qualifications of the mind, though honored, be not charged; for that of the Poll-money was in that exceedingly unjuſt; divers Knights, Eſquires, Doctors, Attornyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not being worth the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney they were aſſeſſed at by the Poll) but I ſay that excepted, they muſt fix a Rule for the value of a Gentleman, Eſquire, Knight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which end, Suppoſe the eſtate of a Gentleman be 300. <hi>li. per annum,</hi> as before, and that this ſhal be charged one horſe: then a Gentleman of 600. <hi>l.</hi> muſt be three; for if that three hundred maintain a Gentleman and one horſe, ſix hundred may maintain two horſes more; and ſo in proportion in all charges and duties in the Commonwealth.</p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:105181:45"/>
                  <p>Theſe Levellers prefer the integrity of a Religious converſation in all things anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſtrictneſs of their holy profeſſion, above all policy and carnal intereſts; therefore they honour rich men, but they eſpecially eſteem and truſt vertuous men; and therefore deſire, that in publike Adminiſtrations the baſis and ſettlement of the Commonwealth may be ſo tempered, that the vertuous, and experienced judicious man may not be caſhiered a fit Regiment for want of Riches, being well knowing that the purity and corruption of intereſt are the props and decayes of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth reſpectively as they are admitted.</p>
                  <p>They deny not that the foundations of <hi>England</hi> ſettlement were juſt, nor that there was alwayes a politick ſettlement held forth; but they ſay it was never practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed as held forth, and yet held forth far ſhort of what the perfection of our profeſſion enlightens unto; whereupon they urge, that the whole frame of our Government, Civil as well as Eccleſiaſtick, ought to be brought to the Standard of Juſtice, at leaſt to that the Declarations of Parliament ſeem to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>old forth, which own as much in Generals, as they deſire in particulars; wherefore they ſay, that they are confident it can now be nothing but corrupt and partial Intereſts that can divide; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deſired, that the foundations being aſſured, the ſuperſtructure might be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable; and that in not only the clearing of the Rights of the ſupreme Magiſtrate, but of the Subjects in all Offices, Truſts, and Degrees, in ſuch a plain, evident Chriſtian manner, that no man might complain juſtly, either that through ignorance he knew not the Law, or difficulty that he could not perform it, or delayes that he were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed inſtead of relieved by it; and to that end deſired the Laws in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> all fained actions and intricacy of pleadings to be annulled, Courts of Law and equity with all other legall proceedings to be in the reſpective Counties; Bargains and Sales, and all conveyances to be enrolled, all Lands to pay debts, Creditors to be paid equally out of the whole eſtate of the Debtor, not preferring fraudulent Judgements before honeſt Bills; all actions under ſuch a value to be determined by any two Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the Limit by their Warrants without Writ, eſpecially at monthly meetings, but more eſpecially if they were both poor, that is, not worth one hundred pound clear, or if but one of them, the poor being grown lately as well enemies and devourers of one another as the rich.</p>
                  <p>That there might be but one waight, whether <hi>Troy</hi> or <hi>Aver du-poiz,</hi> in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo one meaſure; and one tenure, that is Freehold of the State, not grantable to any perſon or perſons, ſo called mean Lords, as tending to the high advancing of particular intereſts, much more ſubject to deſtroy then ſupport the Commonwealth; eſpecially that baſeſt badge of ſlavery, and the moſt prejudicial to the intereſt of a free Commonwealth, the ſo called <hi>Villeni</hi> or bond ſervice, urging that the Rule of <hi>Littleton,</hi> That Land being the leſs worthy cannot engage the perſon of a free man which is more worthy, and ſo that Villenage, or now ſo called Copy-hold, is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with freedome; and the evil effects of this have appeared in choyce of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, as dangerous as ever did any Feife ſervice of the Barons to their Soveraigns the Kings; and they ſay it is juſt the Comminalty ſhould have right done againſt infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Lords, now the Lords have right againſt the King or State, that ſo while we be freed from the Tyranny of a Prince, we may not be worſe ſlaves each to other; for they can inſtance more wicked, unchriſtian, mercileſs, and cruel acts in Copyhold Lords, then in all the Princes in the world.</p>
                  <p>They alſo deſired, if the State took Tonnage, and Poundage, Cuſtomes, &amp;c. that the Seas might be guarded (and ſome ſaid, if they did not, it was lawful to ſteal Cuſtome, but I put that opinion in a Parentheſis) they deſired that no perſon or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of men might be ſecured from Law; that all evils as appearing, might be at ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, rectified; and to that end, that an eaſie addreſs might be to Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſetled in power in the reſpective bounds, both for ending and determining ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law ſetled, and preparing for remedy to emergent evils by certificate of the matter.</p>
                  <p>They ſaid they valued their priviledges as high as any, but they would part with their priviledges of men, to enjoy the priviledge of juſt and wiſe men; they therefore would deny themſelves things lawful, if found inconvenient; thus did they ſubmit to the Magiſtrate, and thought not themſelves wiſer then them whom God ſet over them; but this alſo admitted, that Magiſtrates were men and might err; that the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105181:45"/> rule of their Government being but perfect reaſon, (ſuppoſed that infallibility was not tyed to the Seat of Juſtice, if not to the Throne of the Prince, and Chair of the Biſhop) that it was the duty of the Subject, with fear and humility to adviſe of the Law; and that no man might oppoſe the Law but lawfully; not to be the Authors of diſturbance to the State, leſt each man might contend for his own opinion, until there were as many Laws as men: They ſaid that the poor were a parcel of the body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, which ought to be provided for ſetledly and ſufficiently (ſome propounded Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, ſome concealed Lands, ſome one thing, ſome another; but theſe were miſtaken parties, generally, though well affected they might be; for Commons were the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants Rights originally, not the poors; and concealed Lands might now have proved as fatall a Hawk to the State to whom they now belong, as Forreſt Lands did before to the King; for, as I have ſaid before, all Tenures, Titles, &amp;c. being grown ſo difficult, what might not have been adjudged now concealed, as then was Foreſt?)</p>
                  <p>Theſe men further allowed and deſired, that perſons ſhould be brought into due degrees, the due power of all perſons reſpectively ſetled, the primitive order for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Nation by the enforcing the Laws of Tythings for idle vagrant perſons, Hues and Cryes for Thefts, Robberies, and ſuch like, that due orders of Cities, and Walled Towns, Bridges, and great Roads for Watches, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Regulations of all Trades by certain and juſt Laws might be renewed, Priſons not made the Schools of all Villany, but places of due laborious reſtraint and ſafe keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that ſpecially firſt for perſons criminous, next dangerous, luſty, riotous, lazy, and idle.</p>
                  <p>Publike Offices to be born at the publike charge, and no juſt Office to be the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then or ruine of a man, ſuch as to be a Reader of Inns of Court, High-Sheriff, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, Major, Sheriff, &amp;c. of Counties and Cities.</p>
                  <p>That all Cuſtomes be certain, all Fees of Officers, with a thouſand things more which experience had rendred manifeſtly holding forth Juſtice, or the foundations thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe juſt things being ſo diametrically oppoſite to the Intereſt of multitudes who had for their corrupt intereſt ſake, or to make a fortune in their own Idoliſh phraſe, joyned themſelves to the Parliament party, were heard, but neglected, then ſcandalized to commix Intereſts with the errors afore-ſuppoſed in Levelling in the groſſeſt acceptation; ſo that each rule almoſt of morall honeſty, was now miſcalled Levelling.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why I call theſe juſt things Levelling, is to unmask theſe Satans, and to manifeſt to all men the ſtrange artifices uſed to obſtruct the truth, and take men off from the entertaning true apprehenſions of it, ſuggeſting to them theſe jealouſies; that though the Propoſitions held forth nothing but ſeemingly juſt, honeſt, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, yet no doubt there was a Snake lay in the graſs, to eat in pieces the root of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and debaſe the Supremacy of Magiſtracy, deſtroy order, annihilate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and introduce the confuſion (which ſome, as I have ſaid, are ſaid to intend) and we may juſtly fear, if ſome timely and juſt order preventive be not applyed, will by theſe ſelf-ſeekers be aſſuredly perfected.</p>
                  <p>But all theſe juſt Levellers had not the ſame foundation or principle for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; though know aſſuredly, all honeſt men reall and of publike ſpirits, Papiſt or Kings Proteſtant (that is, he that would walk no further in the way of Chriſt then the Laws of the Land taught him; that is, beleeving as was by Law eſtabliſhed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Canon, &amp;c. yet zealouſly making conſcience of being wiſer then his Teachers) Presbyter or Independent, or of any Sect, Opinion, or Religion ſoever, were nick-named Levellers, by them that found it beſt fiſhing in troubled pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led waters.</p>
                  <p>But as I ſay, they had ſeveral principles; The Presbyter founding his Levelling upon the Judicials of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſtuck to that Rule, that the Judicials were Gods own Law given to his own people, with whom he had entered a Covenant, not only upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> but in the loyns of <hi>Abraham,</hi> father of the faithful, that ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> is our father, and we by faith his ſeed, and ſo bound.</p>
                  <p>Again, that the people choſen of God, were Types of all Gods people, to whom that Law was given in them, and living according to that Law, ſhould thereby mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105181:46"/> themſelves each to other to be the people of God, that Chriſt had not deſtroyed this Law, he came to fulfill it: And laſtly, they enforced this from the rule of reaſon; If man had no boundary to his Reaſon, no rule to make his Law by, reaſon would be infinite, which error had been the foundation of ſo many dreadful alterations as States had ſuffered under, in ſuch clymaterick revolutions as now this Nation laboured under; and therefore they deſired the drawing of <hi>Englands</hi> Laws to their primitive rule, namely the Judicials. This was objected againſt by others, who yet deſired a rule of righteouſneſs, alledging, that if this were the Rule, then it muſt be all ſo, or but part; not all, for the Ceremonial Law being the ſhadow, fled away at the coming of Chriſt in the body; and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had done evil, yea, that it was the foundation and root of their ſo dangerous Apoſtacy, to carry the ſhadow along with the body; for, from thence had come their high power of the Pope, their ſacring of Churches, as well as perſons, their Altars, Trinckets, &amp;c. their Jubiles, Pardons, Indulgences, &amp;c. Canonical hours, holy Veſtments, and all the reſt of their traſh; and that one admitted, all would follow; and as the entertaining the amuſive or formal part of worſhip into religious ſervices, had under the ſupremacy of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick power defiled Church and Commonwealth, taking away all ſence of inward, ſerious, conſcionable, moral duty, as well as religious, and reſting only in the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior form, either the pomp of the action, or the act it ſelf: So now, in the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eccleſiaſtick power, by the Magiſterial Civil power, the Commonwealth would at laſt lay the foundation of a new defilement to the Church; and that this might be, was too too evident by the precedent example: So that we ſhould but change the Tables, and keep the falſe Dice ſtill, which would never better our game; and therefore they ſaid, that unleſs there could be ſhewed exactly which part of the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials, by an infallible word, and that as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> (that is, not as confirmed by Chriſt or his Apoſtles) was the rule of Chriſtian duty, they would take none at all (as ſo given) for if man were Judge of a part of that Law, how agreeable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof he or they were rulers, then of all; and if ſo, then as good take pure reaſon, not contrary to the Law of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, but founded rather upon his Doctrine, in the general rule, though the particular application might vary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of circumſtances, ſo not rejecting the judicials, but not taking them as obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, as given to the Jew, the people of God, or typing out all Chriſtian Nations, or an Enſign of the faith, but as a wiſe Law, yea the wiſeſt, as being the dictates of the prime wiſdom, the ſame God that the Chriſtians worſhipped, they not only admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but deſired ſuch as were conſonant to Chriſtian reaſon to be eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us.</p>
                  <p>There were ſome particular contentions, as firſt for Tythes, ſecondly Appeals, next the Sabboth, then Theft not to be death, then Adultery and Blaſphemy to be death; and theſe were things of principal Intereſt indeed: But the Intereſt (in part, which diſcredited the whole) was ſo viſible, as I cannot allow it, though I may them who ſought the thing as afflicted in ſpirit, ſeeing the want of conſcience in multitudes, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill of all called Miniſters, for ſome evil mens ſakes, open prophanation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both by thoſe profeſſed a Sabboth (and by the laſt Act reſtrained in part, and left in other part as looſe as before) petty Theft, death; yet in the ſame State common and manifeſt Adultery go without any puniſhment or queſtion (&amp; all for want of a rule, for we hear of long debates about it) and Swearing and Blaſphemy almoſt as ordinary as ſpeaking; yet proof made difficult, and puniſhment eaſie, but no conſcience of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming; for few thought it a ſin; for the great men and the wiſe men were moſt guilty and gloried in it; ſo that it was evident, that as ſome ſought the re-eſtabliſhment of the old frame of Government, and that both in Church ſo called and State, according to the old pattern of the Erroneous Church, or Apoſtacy of <hi>Rome,</hi> founding upon the equity and uſeful alluſion (ſo called) of the <hi>Moſaical Judicials</hi> and <hi>Ceremonials;</hi> ſome nothing but confuſion: ſo others deſired one wholly new, avoiding all the errors which corrupt intereſts had introduced; and that not only becauſe the way of Error was before tracked, and therefore eaſie to be trodden anew, but as being builded upon a falſe foundation, as well as by time and error corrupted and perverted.</p>
                  <p>Some of theſe, though holding the truth, were by a part of themſelvs ſuppoſed to be in an error, while preſuming upon the wonderful mercies the Lord had beſtowed upon them, they were over-raſh in their deſires of a change; for the evident ſymptomes of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:105181:46"/> unavoidable ruine, ſay they, threaten us, the multitude of intereſts are ſo divers, and contrary; how few are there to manage ſuch a work? not one to ten, if one to an hundred: this were to tempt God, To expect miracles in a day when miracles ceaſe; God bade the <hi>Jew</hi> not deſtroy all their enemies at once, leſt the beaſts ſhould prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; it may hold forth the ſimplicity of the Dove, but not the ſubtilty of the Serpent, which is requiſite in this caſe; for you ſee, ſay they, what a conteſt hath been with the ſingle intereſt of the Clergy, and the ſcattered fry of their corrupt Courts; but if you engage againſt all the remainders of them, with the numerous off-ſpring of all Courts, as of Judges, Serjeants, Counſellors, Sollicitors, Attorneys, Protho-notaries, Secondaries, Clerks of the Crown, Clerks of Aſsiſe, Clerks of the Exigents, Clerks of the Papers, Clerks of the Warrants, Clerks of the Eſſoyne, Clerks of the Juries, Clearks of the Pipe, Clerke of the Kings ſilver, Clerks of the Seal, Clerk of the Peace, <hi>Cuſtos brevium,</hi> Chyrographers, Fillizer, Marſhals, Cryers, Waiters, Chancellors, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers, Six Clerks, Regiſters, Comptrollers of the Seal, Examiners, Clerk of the Hamper, Clerk of the petty Bag, Curſiters, Serjeants of the Mace, Uſhers of the Court, Clerks in nature of ordinary Attorneys, with many more, and all theſe having their adherents; for which of theſe but come in under ſome corrupt intereſt or other?</p>
                  <p>But generally, the chief in Offices, at leaſt of profit, as Judges, Serjeants, Councellors, Advocates, Doctors, Proctors, Attorneys, Six Clerks, Clerks of Aſſize, &amp;c. are all the younger Brethren, or ſons of Lords, or of their Families, however of the greateſt Gent. and of the Parliament men themſelves, and ſetled by the Baſtard ſo called the Conquerour upon a politick Maxime,</p>
                  <p>That the Land in <hi>England</hi> being appointed for the ſafeguard of the Kingdom, might not be brackled away; therefore as all the Land went to the eldeſt, theſe were the wayes of educating and maintaining the younger, make them Lawyers, and make the Laws dubious, Offices plentiful, and there would be (as experience hath proved it ſufficiently) a plentiful portion; then ſettle Tythes, encreaſe Gleabs, build Monaſteries, &amp;c. and there is another portion, Colledges and Halls I will reckon to them, then Phyſicians and Merchants; ſo that if you ſeek due Reformation, you will make each one your enemie, and the whole world will be againſt you; and nothing but confuſion can be uſhered in by the pretended Reformation; you will have Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, City, Countrey, Lords, Gentry, Comminalty, and all againſt you; nay, if you will purge throughly, you muſt alter the whole courſe of all commerce.</p>
                  <p>For there is no Traffique according to a rule of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Let Errors as they came by degrees, ſo by degrees be reduced, pull out a crazie ſtone, but put in a good one; the contrary party objected, that this was to dawb with untempered Morter, not to ſerve God but themſelves, that it was to pretend to do good, and do evil; that this was the Error of the King and the two firſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that they had upheld following providence, to mount into the Carr of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; that they had dared enough then againſt all intereſts, Kingly, Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, Countrey and City; by their executing <hi>Charls,</hi> and impriſoning the members, Garriſoning the City, &amp; Quartering in the Counties: Thus were matters bandied, and ſome parties grew ſo fierce (as anger is alwayes a ſhort madneſs) that they did they knew not what; which yet teſtified that their anger was ſelfiſh; others more wiſely wrote, but unwiſely in that they remembred not they ſtirred a Lyon; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended ſo much upon their firſt engagement to the Parliament, that they thought they might have ſaid any thing.</p>
                  <p>Let truth bear ſway, ſhe alwayes carrieth a Majeſty and will prevail; but many tell truth, ſome with upbraidings and revilings, ſome with curſings, and others (almoſt all) with bitterneſs; truth is aſhamed by theſe frailties, and ſuffers for a weak ſervants ſake.</p>
                  <p>But theſe men concealed their names; and though ſome wiſe men did ſo, yet their writings were ſuch as could not juſtly be traduced for ſcandall or ſedition; and theſe men neither owned their names when their books were moſt acceptable; nor in times moſt dark and dangerous; but ſome of theſe others owned them ſometimes, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while they denyed them, whereby they were ſuſpected of no great integrity; others did openly own their works in times of great danger under the King, and alſo under the Parliament, yea even when they oppoſed them in their higheſt priviledges, ſome debating one thing, ſome another, yea ſome againſt the publike tranſactions of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105181:47"/> State, and ſome for a general liberty of all opinions, and printing and publiſhing (which to be ſetled with ſafety to the State, and no prejudice to the light of truth, is a matter difficult, but of importance, not to be neglected) they alſo urged to the men in power the hand of God upon the Nation, how introduced, that the ſame or worſe evils were now upon us, our Courts of all ſorts having changed rather their Judges then their juſtice, that Committees were worſe rather then ordinary Courts, as being made of thoſe perſons who were the ſupream Judges; and they erring, all the inferiour wheels might well move out of order.</p>
                  <p>And proceedings in Parliament were the ſame, ſo difficult, dilatory, and ſo expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, that men were even tired in body as in ſpirit; they did acknowledge the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and difficulty of the work, they conſidered intereſts, and yet they thought there was not that expedition or integrity requiſite to ſo high truſts in ſuch a ſeaſon of judgement.</p>
                  <p>And this was evidenced by the expedition in matters of intereſt private (ſo called) that is to the aſſurance of the acquired Supremacy, and raiſing the due aſſeſsments, but not in the general ſettlement as was propounded; this draws ſome men to that piece ſo called the Agreement of the people; a thing, which were the people capable of ſuch a work, might, if rightly ſtated, be of great availe; but indeed to put into the hands of ſo vaſt a multitude, of ſuch divers intereſts, and that without an aſſured and competent number to carry on the work, which in probability they neither had, nor could have had, without imploying the Sword-men (which in it ſelf had totally ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined the nature of an Agreement) had unravelled all the work, and ſet us as far back as at the beginning; but that the propounders of it were turned recreant to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples (ſome particular man might) or had joyned intereſt with the Royall party, I cannot beleeve it.</p>
                  <p>But I ſuppoſe really they were by that party and ſome others of eager ſpirits it may be, really longing and breathing after Righteouſneſs, and ſetling the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt (I fear yet in their own ſtrength) encouraged to go on in their deſign, (which ſome of them politickly ſaw tended to divide, and that was to let them raign) but ſurely theſe Royal inſtigators were men of loſt condition: for what could the iſſue have been, but renewing a more deadly and confuſed warr? for the multitude being by this Act publikely appealed to, and that by the ſole exiſtent power Civill, they muſt have aſſumed the abſolute ſupremacy into the meer vulgar Ocean; and ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er can you ſet bounds to the Ocean then their appetites: This foreſeen, this piece was after long debate, with much wiſdom, for the preſent, caſt into the number of Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Remonſtrances, &amp;c. of Parliament, to be by their mature adviſements qualified, fit for propagating common intereſt in due time; but this obſtruction imbittered the more, and made ſome ſpirits, under concealed, or not owned names, to ſet abroach the failings, errors, and miſcarriages of all the Members in Parliament, or elſe ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize them; and pinching ſtill the ableſt and activeſt, they hoped to foyl ſo, that ſome ſoyle ſhould remain, though moſt would not gain credit.</p>
                  <p>Far be it from me, pretending integrity, to aſſert what I know not, but I muſt hope the Charges againſt ſome men, if not the moſt, are meerly ſuggeſtions of envy to eminent vertue; for I ſee great things done by them, and their words are ſweet as honey: Truth is, I am not ſo blind neither, but I can ſee and hear that favour and friendſhip is the Miſtreſs with the State, as it was at Court; and oppreſſion and covetize is not ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <hi>Englands</hi> Commonweale; but I muſt ſay, that retorted, is as true, namely, that it is incident to men neglected to complain, and ſo to men oppreſſed; I would allow an equall and ſpeedy tryall according to my rule, even to my deadlieſt (manly) enemy; the want of this hath much exaſperated many, and gained none cordially.</p>
                  <p>Now in all this enarration, you ſay, what coherence is there 'twixt Chriſt and his Doctrine; his profeſſors, and their converſation? had we not better have ſate ſtill? How many thouſands, nay ten thouſands hath this Warr coſt, as in the Kingdomes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is evident? But I cannot agree the Doctrine, it was neceſſary to purge, it is evident there was need and great need of Reformation; let not the particular errors of Reformers cauſe us to fall out with duty; But while they fail, let us as we ſhould, ſeek the Lord with double diligence. I know there is much objected, but the matters moſt eyed, are firſt of purſe-concernment, as the Taxes or Aſſeſsments for the Army,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105181:47"/> the Exciſe, Cuſtoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein many that are contented to pay, do yet much repine at the inequality of the levy.</p>
                  <p>But as to them I muſt ſay, I know they in Supream truſt have of late done much, nay, almoſt as much as in them lies; its perticular intereſt now obſtructs; the real truth is, corrupt principles have ſuch root in us, that gain is above all godlineſs; men eminent could be willing all others ſhould have Juſtice, ſo they might be favored.</p>
                  <p>Yet this one thing might well be yet provided for in the Act, that perſons of not above four pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> and not able to work; or having a charge of children, and no perſonal eſtate, to the value of ten pounds, and not being Farmers, but living upon that, ſhould not be charged; many now paying twenty ſhillings <hi>per annum</hi> to the war, who are fitter to receive collection; and many worth four or five thouſands, nay ten thouſand pounds perſonal eſtate, not taxed at all; or if at all, not above one ſhilling or one ſhilling ſix pence for three months.</p>
                  <p>The next matter chiefly eyed was (after the alteration of the State from a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy to a Free State or Republike) to conſider what ſhould now be done to make good that freedom promiſed; and the firſt, or one of the firſt matters exiſtent as a Law, was the Act for Treaſons; the Objections againſt the ſubſtance of the Act as to the matters what is Treaſon, I for the preſent omit to relate, but paſs to the forfeiture, which is to the State as to the King; and this ſome humbly conceive not agreeable to the rule of juſt Freedom; hear their reaſons ſhortly.</p>
                  <p>They ſay firſt, That it is unjuſt to puniſh the childe for the fathers offence; that it is evident that this was not the original Law of <hi>England,</hi> Nature, or Nations, but the uſurpation of Princes Heathen, imitated by Chriſtians for profit ſake; that it is a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to think love of the eſtate, or of wife, or children, will deter, where the life is not conſidered; and that this layes the ſame foundation for the State to ſeek by the rigour of Laws to gain eſtates to it ſelf, as in the King; ſo that now our condition is not bettered in our Liberties; for as our Supreames may be more merciful; ſo they may be more rigorous; the ſettled equal Law is the Subjects beſt priviledge.</p>
                  <p>Again, In the Act for Treaſon, they ſay, this ſeeking of intereſt is evident in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of Coynage of money, Clipping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being a work private, much evil may be done, and no legal diſcovery made, as late frequent practiſe in all places hath evidenced; but to put a penalty upon the offerer of it, would ſoon give a full ſtop to it; and that is the beſt Law which effects its ends with leaſt publike or private detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; now to forfeit the piece ſo clipped, filed, or rounded, would ſtop the currant; but to forfeit that, and ſo much more, would dry it up quickly, eſpecially if it had an eaſie Trial, as before the next Juſtice, or two next Conſtables, or ſome certain number of the neighbourhood, and the faulty money immediatly to be cut in pieces: I ſpeak not of Coyning, Stamping, Counterfeiting, and Waſhing; let due penalties be (by Law) impoſed; onely trial ſpeedy and eaſie.</p>
                  <p>The next Act controverted, is that of Printing; the Objections againſt which being publikely avowed in Print, though ſome may ſay more wittily then with found Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian conſideration, I ſhall here onely ſay thus much, that as is there in part held forth, it is likely to be found the beſt expedient to ſtop the current of calumnious Printing, not to do things ſubjecting to ſcandal; and aſſuredly all moderate men will aſſert the Magiſtrate againſt the Calumniator, if to this end the Preſs were open, provided that each man would own his work; and like the old Greekiſh propounder of a new Law, write under the peril of his life; it might be an uſeful expedient to take off Tryflers, though it might endanger many, whoſe zeal were either too much, or knowledge too little.</p>
                  <p>I am now come ſhortly to the great rubb at preſent, which is the Engagement, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which none ſure but preingaged perſons can (as matters ſtand) object juſtly; for otherwiſe to reſolve Conſcience, we muſt ravel the Succeſſions of all powers; for if the actual poſſeſſion of the Supream power, doth not inable to require all Political o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, then ſurely acqueſts without juſt Title are void, if ſo time cannot remedy it, if ſo it concerns all powers to juſtifie to each Scrupler, not onely his pedegree, but the juſtice of it from the beginning (I may ſay of the world) but it is plain the Boglers at the work are ſuch as look for an other change: It is certain, Protection requires Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and it is as certain that they are happy in Politicks, who in the Changes of Government are ſo diſpoſed by the Supream Wiſdom (for mans alone will not avail)
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105181:48" rendition="simple:additions"/> that they exerciſe the extream or height of Rigidity or Mercy aright (for one is ever found neceſſary.)</p>
                  <p>And now I am come to the laſt great conteſt, the peoples Liberties: The queſtions are firſt concerning an extraordinary Commiſſion to try ſitting the odinary Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the holding up the hand, opening of doors, both which were preſſed; I fear ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make a party, and oppoſe the preſent Power, then out of Conſcience I omit them here.</p>
                  <p>The next was, Whether in Caſe of Life a man may have Councel?</p>
                  <p>A third, Concerning the lawfulneſs of requiring, and taking the general plea, not guilty.</p>
                  <p>The laſt, Whether the Iury be Iudges meerly of fact or of Law alſo; and to theſe well may be added two things more, namely the Queries concerning maintenance in priſon, And arreſting by an armed power in the time of peace.</p>
                  <p>All which indeed are of main concernment to the Nation and people; yea, even as much as Lives and Liberties, matters of the moſt pretious reſpect with men, and juſtly to be inquired into, wherein I ſhall only ſhortly give the general Opinions and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men wiſe and deſiring juſt things, but withall entreating briefly of the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of our Laws proſecution which hitherto hath been purpoſely waved.</p>
                  <p>I take it, that the Law of <hi>England,</hi> according to the rule before ſaid down, owns a twofold way of bringing perſons criminous to trial; which is, that of appeal, of which I ſhall onely hint what it was, being now a thing, as before I ſaid, wholly diſuſed, namely, it is a proſecution of the party, be it for Maihem or Felony of any ſort, and in the name of the party appealing; which ſuit he might by the Law compound for, and releaſe, yea, if it were for murder (at leaſt it was ſo uſed) which liberty being much abuſed, the parties, who upon the heat of the blood, that is, while the injury was freſh complained, were bound over by Recognizance to proſecute for the King; and ſo were the Witneſſes; (but if the party, or the Witneſſes, ſhould refuſe it, it might much be ſcrupled, what by our Law ought to be done to inforce them juſtly; but Cuſtome hath prevailed) to go by ſteps: The places of Trial of Crimes, are either the Ordinary, as Kings-Bench, or Statute-Seſſions, or the Extraordinary, and yet Ordinary, <hi>viz.</hi> the Commiſſions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter.</hi> and Gaol Delivery carried down alwayes with the Iuſtices of <hi>Niſi Prius</hi> at the Aſſizes, or the legal Extraordinary, which were an aſſotiation of more men then ordinary, according to the novelty and exigency of the cauſe, moſt legally and uſually made up of all the Iudges of all the Benches, and no other, and heard in the Checkquer Chamber. Now theſe are not to be ſcrupled in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; the other, and which are extraordinary and ſcrupled as illegal, are meer Royal Commiſſioners conſiſting of Iudges, Lords, and other men, according to the pleaſure of the prime Magiſtrate; and theſe were rare, and but in caſe of great offences or doubts of imminent, at leſt ſo pretended concernment.</p>
                  <p>And there were two Cauſes, the one profeſſed, which was the reſolution of many wiſe men ſworn to do right, according to Law, betwixt the King or State, and the Subject, who by concurrent Votes aſſured the intereſt of either party; and ſurely, were the Law by which they judged as plain and evident, as the reaſon or foundation of their extraordinary judgements, there would be no exception; but the fear heretofore on the peoples part which is the ground to the preſent jealouſies, was in reſpect that Commiſſions pretended of that nature, were aiding to the inchroaching vertue of the Supream Power, to the advance of Prerogative, eſpecially after King <hi>James</hi> had made the Iudges (which were the leaders in both theſe powers) his meer Creatures by abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute dependance in altering their Patents, as aforeſaid, from during their well abearing to during his pleaſure: How the Iudges Patents are now, I know not; but except the preſent condition of affairs make that now lawful, which in it ſelf is not, ſurely ſuch Arbritrary Patents are introductive of the heights of vaſſalage; for if they in each Punctilio advance not the intendments and intereſts on foot of the Supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, be it good or evil, for God, or againſt Liberty or Bondage: A Writ of Eaſe is next to be expected, and that engages to the ſlander of every malitious enemy, and he now lies open to the laſh of every accuſer; eſpecially if any litigious perſon hath been overthrown before him, O how the man buſtles, and now is his time for revenge! our eys have ſeen this, and this I ſuppoſe to be the ground of fears of ſuch Commiſſions.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:105181:48"/>
                  <p>I willingly avoid Ravelling Controverſies upon preſidents, which in our Laws are ſo many, and ſo diverſe each from other, and multitudes ſo contrary each to other, as ſupream or moſt excellent reaſon muſt bear ſway; and then the <hi>arbitrium</hi> of the Commiſſion will not be ſo much the queſtion, as the Law by which judged. If it be objected againſt the adjoyning in Royal Commiſsions, that they are nor Lawyers nor Iudges in Ordinary, but Merchants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, there lies an Appeal to Parliament, from any Court, Ordinary, or Extraordinary, which receives Commiſsion under the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Authority.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, they are meerly the States Pentioners, then the Argument is againſt the Supream Magiſtrate mediately, againſt their Iudges immediately, and is remedied by appeal; but this is manifeſt, that there is no neceſsity of theſe Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; they were continually declaimed againſt, and denied as one gap to invade the native proper liberty of the Subject, and if now inforced, can but foment jealouſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the State.</p>
                  <p>Having now found out the proper Courts of Trial of criminal perſons; let us ſee who the criminous perſon is, and how to be dealt withal; the criminous perſon is vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken to be him that is accuſed, Legally him that is convicted, not differencing where upon examination before the Iuſtice there is confeſsion of the party, full evidence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on oath, violent preſumptions, or barely ſuſpition; but all are dealt withal alike, except they miſdemean themſelves; and in caſe the matter be baylable, baylable alike, few Iuſtices looking at good bail, but all the Clerks at their Fees; in which caſe much error is where the Clerk is Iuſtice of the Peace, or <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Iuſtice not able, or too proud to draw a Warrant himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> and juſt reaſon, mens liberties being highly priſed; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore men were to be tried the next Gaol delivery; I mean at the Seſsions for the County; but now by a Statute made in the time of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> or at leaſt under pretence of it, all matters criminal being death, that is, out of the Rogues City of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge; that is, to which they cannot readily plead guilty of all Felonies within Clergy, the ſtill continued ſhame of <hi>England;</hi> ſo that ſome uſe a hateful Proverb, (All Rogues to the Clergy, and all Clergy to the Gallows) they muſt be tried at the ſo called Aſsiſes.</p>
                  <p>This Statute was a great friend to the Clerk of the Aſsize, above the Clerk of the Peace; and thoſe Iuſtices that will not ſee this Statute, the Inquiſitive Clerk of Aſsiſe can ſpy his time to fit him if he cometh in his compaſs, which may be every Aſsiſes; and though preſent, put him down abſent, ſo he is fined forty ſhillings; and to remedy it, will coſt twice ſo much.</p>
                  <p>Now in the Gaols, the Schools of Iniquity, they are not imployed; and if any one will imploy himſelf, he muſt purchaſe his liberty to uſe his Trade at the Gaolers diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for there is no Law for it, no not for Debtors; ſo that having nothing to do, the Priſoners confer notes; and the older Thief, Cutpurſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſtill inſtructs the yonger in the revealed quidities of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Vain people think highly of theſe nice evaſions of Law; but the ſerious ſees it makes the Law ridiculouſly difficult; the great Rogues ſcape, but the ignorant and unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced dye for it: All honeſt men love mercy, and are as loth ſimple Felony ſhould be death as any; but they would not men ſhould by Cuſtom abuſe juſt things, or endure unlawful ones, or connive at wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>Yet theſe and multitudes more well known, have long, and do ſtill paſs unremedied, or are provided for but in part, or for a parcel of the Commonwealth; So that it is certain, the generalty of men which once come into <hi>Englands</hi> priſons of all ſorts (as now uſed) are ſpoiled for ever, both as to induſtry and honeſty; yea, ſo notorious is the evil, that I have known many Juſtices avow, it was their ſorrow to be in place, to be inſtrumental to ſuch evils, by ſending one for his firſt offence to Gaol, and likely to be amended; but ſent to Gaole (whither he muſt go) he was irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably loſt.</p>
                  <p>Now for maintenance in priſon, originally in ſuch caſes as the State was forfeited, as in Treaſons and Felonies which were tryed very ſpeedily, the State was ſeized by a publick Officer by way of ſecuring, and the wife and children if any were, continued in the houſe, &amp;c. giving ſecurity the goods were not imbezeled, and nought removed or ſold, unleſs for the mainteance of the priſoner, the forfeiture then reaching from the time of the fact committed; and then though this were juſt, there was this injuſtice
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105181:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> that the forfeiture paid no debts, an unjuſt and unchriſtian thing, yea if opened, the looſe or inlet to abominable, cheating cozenage and knavery.</p>
                  <p>Now the Law is (that is, practice conſtant) that the priſoner maintain himſelf, till himſelf, wife and children are undone, by ſelling all they have for the maintenance of the priſoner, and paying Gaole Fees (though he be not guilty, a moſt wicked thing) and this happily for acts or words no way Treaſonable, Felonious, &amp;c. or for ſuch matter, which none but a malicious Adverſary would have proſecuted.</p>
                  <p>And to ſay the King paid his priſoners Fees, is but to argue from matter of fact; for take a priſon properly, it is but as a pound to dammagious beaſts, and in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per pound the owner muſt provide for them, and they that offend muſt provide for themſelves, or rely on charity; It is truth, it is but juſt, that in caſe of (ſo called) il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal, or in caſes dubious, whether baylable or not, or where baylable, yet for good cauſe denyed; and in all extraordinary impriſonments, that is, by abſolute power in limited Monarchy, being cauſes for which the Law provided not, it ſeems reaſonable, that the ſame power that commits ſhould ſuſtain, untill the Law adjudges the offence; for in that caſe the reſtraint of a Free-man ſeems puniſhment enough; now for ſuch a man how he comes into priſon, that is, whether by the ordinary Officer of Juſtice, as a Conſtable, or by an extraordinary hand, as by armed men, is not material; but the Quaere muſt be rightly ſtated;</p>
                  <p>That is, whether in a time of full peace, no enemy appearing, nor to be feared, a Subject may be by Law arreſted by an Armed power; as to this it is ſaid, that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Law to be the iſſue of perfect reaſon, it is a matter worth mature adviſement; for the life of liberty lies in it, that is, the refuge of the Subject againſt the powers or authority, call them what you wil; for commonly the Souldiery are either in body, and ſo obey no common Arreſts and Proceſſes of ſet Courts; or dibanded; and ſeldome an active man in his own County, and well known, will appear in acts of high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priviledge; ſo that offenders in this kind are ſeldome worth ſuing upon a treſpaſs, and the law of retaliation rather ſatiates the brutiſh then the manly paſſion or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bondage for ſatisfaction hath been hitherto exploded.</p>
                  <p>Others ſay, the crime is to be looked at, and then no matter who executes it; as in Felony, each man may by Law arreſt; and then if every man will, it is neither Riot nor Conſpiracy, what ever it may be called: Others rejoyn to both parts, and ſay that they are ſadly diſtreſſed to ſee the various intereſts of perſons, leading one way to day, another to morrow, which their diverſity of opinions fully demonſtrate. They deſire plain truth with Iuſtice, and to that end they ſay that both are lawfull, time and perſon conſidered; and that this conſideration is and muſt be left to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, who muſt not ſtick ſo in the bare letter, that he loſe the evident meaning of the Law, and ought to be puniſhed as a defaulter againſt his truſt, ſhould he not in ſome cauſes uſe extraordinary power; for the Commonwealth muſt not be without ſufficient power to defend it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And therefore they ſay, that if the Law doth not provide for ſuch emergencies, he ought to be defaulted if he improves not his power to the diſcharge of his truſt, that is the peace and ſafety of the Commonwealth, though he incurrs the lurch of the Law according to the old Letter.</p>
                  <p>The example was under the late King <hi>James</hi> at his comming to the Crown, when after the death of famous <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the County of <hi>York</hi> raiſed men and armed them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a ſort of out-laws, which Act was by the letter of the Law Treaſon, &amp;c. but upon debate, wary enough, it was reſolved their duty, and they had their pardon; againſt which only ſome object, ſaying, that if in reaſon they offended not, why ſhould they be pardoned?</p>
                  <p>Now this is anſwered, others might elſe be imboldened without due cauſe, which ſay the objector's is nugatory; there is nothing of weight in the caſe more then the Officers Fees of ſuing out the pardon; and to ſtop that ſcandal, let ſuch pardons iſſue of courſe by a day at the Officers penalty; ſo that the party ſhall not need pay for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; but as to the caſe in hand, it is propounded, that in caſes of doubting it were better to aſſure all fears, to let the Souldier be but aſſiſtant to the ſetled officer, and not uſed but in evident neceſſity; but the thing is the ſame; I muſt agree the priſon may be any where by the law, which men in point of favour eaſily plead; but touched, then the Court of guard is a priſon, then <hi>White-Hall,</hi> the head-quarters, every thing is odious;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105181:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> but were this ſame man put there under what he counted a civility, it ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; it may be therefore of great policy this was left in the Judges breſt, to endear by ſuch circumſtantials where he ſaw cauſe; but this was altered upon good reaſon in part, and priſons made publick, ſet, and certain, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The next thing is, to bring the priſoner to his Tryal, wherein the Law as I ſaid, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring life, gives priviledges of no evident reaſon, in caſe of crimes worthy of death, eſpecially the certain offendor preſent.</p>
                  <p>Truth is, if the pretended Law of <hi>England</hi> did, as many of the Officers of it do, think one thing, and ſpeak another, tell them they are to dye, while the priſoner knows Mr. Ordinary (ſay the Judge what he will) will openly, prophanely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian-like of courſe lye out a <hi>Legit</hi> (though he knows never a letter, and his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence never grumble to give ſentence accordingly) it were not worthy queſtion, but evident reaſon being its guide, why ſhould they queſtion thirty ſix men without any cauſe, or with a wiſe Sheriff, &amp;c. is that ſo called priviledge ought at all? yet this in ſome caſes is highly advanced; this paſt, and that he is to plead, which ought to be openly, the doors not ſhut during the Tryal, (the Law of God, of <hi>England,</hi> common reaſon, and conſtant practice of Nations agrees it)</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he may make all by the Law void in the Letter, by an appeal; yea I take it alſo without ſhewing any cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Next, by pleading to the Juriſdiction:</p>
                  <p>Next, by denying himſelf to be the party, with multitudes more, how evident ſoever.</p>
                  <p>Which Laws in the letter, being taken advantage of, as one for example; one firſt called ſaid nothing, then ſhewed his name was not <hi>John,</hi> but <hi>John-as Jenkins,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not the party indicted: That amended, the Clerk goes on, <hi>John-as Jenkins</hi> of, &amp;c. he anſwers not after much debate; there is two Towns, one <hi>Hoph. Pet.</hi> the other <hi>Jo.</hi> and the Indictment is general, he knows not which; that agreed on, then his addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is miſtaken, as he is Baronet, indicted Knight, or Knight and Baronet; but all agreed on, he is then to plead, and to this he pleads,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſtrange dilatory pleas, as that the fact was done in another County, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe breeding great trouble and great delay, were both in Civil and Criminal caſes in great part rectified; but ſo jealous was the Parliament ever of the thing called Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, that all was never done (though it may be the greater evils were removed) ſo that there are cauſes enough ſtill to dally in Law, to general diſadvantage of honeſt and publike good, and no liberty but of general capital offenders.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon of this was evident, becauſe the Subjects Liberty was by Princes ſought to be totally enſlaved; the beſt and wiſeſt were moſt active in oppoſition, and to ſave theſe good men, we enſnarled the Law, and till now had never opportunity of rectification; if yet we have this ſeen by the Crown ſide, they engage three wayes, by Judges abſolutely depending, A Jury of Conformiſts, and the general Plea, not guilty: And thus Prerogative and Priviledge fought; And ſurely the Law holds forth matter ſo clear in the Year-Books, on the one ſide by Preſidents, Rights of Supremacy, diſpatch of buſineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, by Preſidents, reaſon of Priviledge, for ſafety of Life, that the controverſie ſeems endleſs, and yet Juſtice is plain; let him plead not guilty, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all give what other matter he can in evidence, which the Court ought to accept, and upon the whole matter, to give judgement, hearing himſelf and Councel; which ſurely if in any other Cauſe, Matter, or Plaint, a Subject ought to have, then much more in caſe of life, eſpecially if the Law favors it; and more eſpecially where the Judges are the meer Dependants of the Prince or State; which jealouſie cannot be ſatisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, if withall other things can be ſuppoſed any way requirable; and therefore it hath been accounted for Law, that the Jury were not barely Judges of the fact; but were ſurely intended as a barr to Prerogative in ſome ſort or dependance thereon; for they may be without all doubt ſo far Judges, as to finde the matter ſpecially, will the Judge or nill he, and if themſelves will venture an attaint, may be Judges of the Law indeed againſt the plaineſt evidences.</p>
                  <p>So that it is evident theſe queſtions are eaſie to be controverted, and hard to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, yet not in themſelves, but only becauſe of the divers intereſts in this, as in moſt matters in our Law, wherein the Crown had any hook, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105181:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> of their party, having laid foundations for their own benefits, and advancing their particular deſigns, which is the firſt riſe of the controverſie about the Militia, which never was in <hi>England</hi> in the Kings hand, otherwayes then that of Tenures, the <hi>poſſe Comitatus</hi> being alwayes the proper defence of the County, and not ſubjugated to the Kings will or Royal Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon was, War and Peace was nominally in the King, really in the Subject, becauſe of Moneys, which could not be charged without conſent in Parliament; ſome upon this, ground a Quaere of main concernment;</p>
                  <p>Namely, what are the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> or where to be found? Some as I have ſaid, anſwer, the Law of God; others ſay, excellent reaſon; ſome the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions peculiarized by uſe; others ſay with the Lawyers, That the Law of <hi>England</hi> is founded upon the Law of God, the Law of Reaſon, principles called Maximes, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes not contrary to reaſon, received time out of mind (and proper <hi>quarto modo</hi> to the people of the Nation) Statutes, and the reſolutions of the Judges: To this it is objected, that theſe generals teach or edifie not what the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>For the Quaere is, If the word of God, whether all, or part; if ſo, the infallible, or at leaſt certain Rule (pleadable) to know which part; they require the like certainty in reaſon, and the Expoſition of Principles and Cuſtomes; for they ſay all theſe muſt ſolely depend upon the Iudges, and then the Law in their opinion is wholly Arbitrary; for if their only word makes it reaſon, and their only word determines the end and meaning of the principle; and ſo whether cuſtome be good or not, then it is meerly at the will of them; and this they ſay experience manifeſted in the great Cauſe of Ship-Money, wherein had not the Sword been the better Arbiter of their priviledge, the ſentence had been irrevocable to enſlave them all to the King; Therefore they ſay, there muſt be common reaſon, or ſome head-Rule, which muſt judge moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent reaſon, not that they intend vulgar deciſion, but a judgement muſt be tryed by its conducing to publike good.</p>
                  <p>The Rule is; Good, the more general and common, ſo much the more precious; and from this they conclude all theſe heads of the Law of Nature or Reaſon, Principles, or Maxims, and Cuſtomes to be all the ſame with the <hi>dicta ſap.</hi> or reſolutions of the Judges; and then whoſe creatures they are, and from whom they have their honour, pay, &amp;c. to them they will be bound, which they caſt not by way of <hi>odium</hi> upon them, but common to them with all men to enforce and improve all their abilities by the firſt principle of nature, to the preſerving ſelf; and this they do, and better ſelf, in advancing the Title and Intereſt of them upon whom they depend.</p>
                  <p>But they ſay, this is as fatal a hawk to liberty to have ſuch an abſolute depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon a State, as upon a Prince, tending to the ſame end of enſlaving the people,</p>
                  <p>Yea, reducing a State from a <hi>Democracie</hi> to a Tyranny, as well as from Royalty to Tyranny; for they ſay they have heard from Lawyers, and it is a general complaint, That the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are they know not what (at leaſt a wiſe, or ſo called Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Judge, may make them ſo, and that this is eaſilieſt done in matters of higheſt concernment.)</p>
                  <p>Take them to be the Law of God, no ſuch matter; where is ought according to that rule? (They exemplifie in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eights Law for marriages made meerly for private intereſts, and now for the ſame neglected) for Gods Name is ſcandalized, prophaned, blaſphemed, and not regarded; horrible adulteries, and ſome ſay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſts unpuniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Yea, all the rabble of Popiſh, Epiſcopal, and now ſo called Presbyterial Profeſſors (that is, the baptized Chriſtian) are guilty of walking clean contrary to their profeſſion, yet no way puniſhed; Gods Sabboth contemned; god-Mammon, that mental Adultery of Idolatry is moſt of their ſin, common to them with their other brethren in the fleſh, by what names ſoever called or known.</p>
                  <p>And for the duty towards Neighbour, there is nothing but envying and malice, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting, gluttony or drunkenneſs, the Nurſes to Adultery and Laſciviouſneſs, with pride in apparel, and abundance of idleneſs, which increaſing, poor increaſes, and by them neceſſity, and that brings Theft, or Covetize or both, and ſure among ſuch to ſwear in truth will not at all be regarded; it will be thought cruelty not to tell an (Officious ſo
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105181:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> called) lye to ſave thy brothers life, which now makes it nothing to have lyes ſworn; this brings ſcandals upon ſeats of Iuſtice; for theſe things known and not remedied, if poſſible, will aſperſe.</p>
                  <p>But ſome ſay, ſome Judges make no conſcience of ſuch acts; they exemplifie, not only in Ship-Money, but in ordinary Tryals, while they deny juſtice by delaying, and admitting the continuance of delayes in juſtice, and ſometimes go againſt their own knowledge in the Law; as in the caſe of admitting ſuch to read as they know cannot, and more evidently ſuch as are not capable by Law, as thoſe branded before, not once, but ſeven times, whereby the Rogue is as preſerved, ſo encouraged; and this becauſe due notice is not taken of perſons branded in the Calender, nor Records penally preſented in Court; to which, though ignorant perſons anſwer, they will not come there again, but act their Villainies in another County; wiſe men will not, who know the Law admits no going out (for it will prove wandring in ſuch of neceſſity) but with Certificate; but the true reaſon, though it cannot wholly excuſe, is the beſt, namely, they think the Law too hard, and would rather have conſtant work-houſes; but there is two evils in this ſo juſt, ſo righteous a propoſal, to change this Law; for if either work-houſes or due courſe of certificates were ſetled, the Commonweale would be quickly rid of ſuch vermin.</p>
                  <p>But then the firſt evil appears, namely, Clerks Fees would ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>The next evil is the matter of charge in building, repairing, and maintaining the houſes, and Officers, &amp;c. for a work-houſe in this age, where building, back and belly cat up all, will hardly be maintained, much leſs raiſed; but to be well provided with ſtock and Overſeers, rather venture all.</p>
                  <p>There is complaint againſt our now Iudges taking Fees (if ſo they do) having yet 1000. l. <hi>per annum,</hi> that Fees might be diſcharged.</p>
                  <p>But theſe Complainers have one word more to the Law, that is, they ſay the great Charter of <hi>Normandy</hi> they own rather to be the old <hi>Norman</hi> Laws before <hi>William</hi> the Baſtard, then the Law of <hi>England,</hi> though he might well labour to introduce the whole plot; Truth, it will ſerve to diſcover the Reaſons of our bondage, and that's all, which while Copyholds are not diſcarded, together with Crown Tenure, we are not freed of.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Fleta</hi> and <hi>Bracton,</hi> they ſay, they are the meer heads of <hi>Juſtinians Inſtitutes</hi> a little corrected according to the guiſe of <hi>Englands</hi> Principles of liberty above the Ancient Roman, or State of <hi>Greece</hi> in the height of the Empire;</p>
                  <p>Yet for that, exploded by the Kings Iudges. For <hi>Horn, Britton, Glanvil,</hi> they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted more <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but may be as well <hi>Scottiſh, Sweadiſh,</hi> or <hi>Daniſh,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> who if compared with <hi>R. Mai. Scot,</hi> the old Tenures, Cuſtomes, Services, Writs, &amp;c. are the ſame word for word; the other were they who drew the Traditions of our fathers into form, by inſenſible degrees, raiſing debaſed <hi>Engl.</hi> to a glimmering of Native liberty in the uſe of a body of law; for it is plain <hi>Englands</hi> Law unwritten could not be well known by the vulgar.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Forteſcue</hi> taking the advantage of the conteſt betwixt <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> declares more freedome (happily then conſiſts with reaſon in the letter) Now all theſe books were altogether exploded; <hi>Fleta</hi> and <hi>Horn</hi> not permitted to be printed, but hung up by the licence liberty; and all that was the common reading of the Lawyer, was the reſolutions of the Iudges in the ſo called Year-Books, which have no date beyond <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, there being then a ſtipend given to certain men conſtantly ſitting in Court, to report the reaſons of the Iudges, ſo that let them anſwer at their perill; for now their reaſons were permanent, and brought to ſtrict judgement.</p>
                  <p>Yet they ſtill had their evaſions in caſes of great intereſt, either for one Kings Title or other, for Prerogative or Priviledge, as particular reſpects engaged, and providence favoured, as was evident in the caſe of <hi>R.</hi> 2. and his Iudges which lay aſleep from him, till our late <hi>Charls</hi> revived it, and ſuffered publickly for it, as <hi>Richard</hi> did privately; far the more manly and exemplary way of the two, and rational it is; for if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for man to give Law, he may and ought to enforce; and no way can be more conſentaneous to order, then that of the body Repreſentative, which is not in this caſe denyed either by the Regular Presbyterian, or violent ſo called Interdependent; only they deny this a Parliament, as before is ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Reporters wrot till <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh; there are ſome fragments of <hi>Henry</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:105181:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> the eight, <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> taken by Students then, and ſince, which are called by the names of the Authors, as <hi>Kelway, Petty, Brook, Dyer, Plowden, &amp;c.</hi> with ſome particular aſſertions of others, but none durſt write freely. Lord <hi>Cook</hi> put out ſeveral Books of Reports, all which being principally matters of Title; or betwixt party and party, ſwam down ſtream: Now in moſt of theſe were matters altered at pleaſure; for out of theſe books it is eaſie to argue black white, and white black; Reaſon was cut into ſuch fine ſhreads of wit (and form which is as vain) that judgement was puzled to find ſomething where there was ſo much of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and if any thing were, it was ſo disjoynted a piece in 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. debated further 18<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. further, Proceſs in 23<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. and finiſhed 31<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Jan.</hi> 24<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>ultimo Regis Caroli Rex ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Brittannorum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſubtile Oracle, true and not true, let matters paſs as they will, ſo that in ſuch a confuſed ſtudy who could learn ought, though helped with <hi>Fitz-Herberts,</hi> yea and <hi>Brooks</hi> Abridgement; for the old Books and the late Indexes, the leaſt too big for any book of Law for a Nation, where each is to be ſuppoſed knowing of it, and no man excuſed by his ignorance.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Crown Law, of which we had no compleat Tract but <hi>Stamford,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cook</hi> treating of that particular and tacitly in his both Juriſdictions of Courts, and Expoſitions of Statutes, holding forth not only the bare letter, but a rational diſquiſition of the Texts, they alſo were eſtopped; and well is it, ſay ſome, if they have not met with a concealed Dominicane Expurgator, or Jeſuitical Emendator, there being ſuch hard hold on all ſides, for them, and againſt them, ſince pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things reſented as grievances in the Kings times, and promiſes to be ruled better then under the beſt of Kings; the King gone, the enquiry and expectation is, what alteration.</p>
                  <p>If we quaere among the Profeſſors, O Lord what cauſe is given to the Adverſary to blaſpheme, while many ſeeming Saints, earneſt Profeſſors and zealous above multitudes, count God a mockery, his Scriptures politick obſervations of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall men!</p>
                  <p>The Devil, every man that is oppoſite to their worſe then Heatheniſm; and how few glorifie the Lord in theſe things, and magnifie his mercies to them, that they are not withdrawn, but rather make uſe of it, through the ſubtilty of Satan, to upbraid the Truth with Error and Hereſie, Contradiction and Confuſion; and theſe aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the godly wiſe Biſhops foreſaw this evil which is now befallen the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God, and admire their way, when they and their way are periſhed together with their revenues, which were according to their own method totally aboliſhed; only the ſeat of the Beaſt is by providence reſerved, to what end I will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie; And who mourns in ſecret for theſe things? In the Commonwealth they ſee little; but hope, though the unſeaſonable oppoſitions hinder at preſent, they ſhall ſee it in due time effected.</p>
                  <p>If you look at the other party of Profeſſors, whether Congregational or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, their jealouſies are as great; and notwithſtanding the Independent (ſo called) had the right hand of fellowſhip in the preſent power, and was not ſo rigid towards the Presbyter; yet the root of oppoſition ſprouted, though I hope the light of grace will nip it the bud.</p>
                  <p>But the Presbyters intereſt is the root of the image, the ſtump, and will not eaſily yield, I mean humane prudence to be admitted the Church.</p>
                  <p>But look to the ordinary Pariſh Prieſt, of what opinion ſoever, they are as diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in the generality to God and goodneſs as before; for as in branding the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie Rogue, there was no Regiſter, ſo that the Rogue had priviledge ſix or ſeven times; ſo the ejected Clergy for want of regiſtring and tranſmitting to every Committee the ejection, the ſcandalizing ones are admitted five, ſix or ſeven times over; and let a ſtander by judge; he cannot find this to be done upon any rational ground, other then more work for the Committee, and ſo more fees for the Clerks.</p>
                  <p>And if it were not ſuch liſtening or truſting to Clerks, what could draw from ſuch wiſe men, ſober, grave, and outwardly pious, things ſo diſſonant from reaſon, and their profeſſion, and the intention of their original conſtitution, by this means as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable or the like? the work is great, much done, and never the neerer an end; for
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105181:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> turn them out of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> they go into <hi>Suffolk,</hi> thence to <hi>Lincoln,</hi> &amp;c. And juſt and good men are ejected upon ſmall matters rather then contend.</p>
                  <p>And the pious zealous Chriſtian againſt the evil one is tired out with vexation of minde, labour of body, and purſe-paiment under renewed evils of the ſame ſtamp; ſo that the moſt and worſt ſtill remain, and many ill ones new ſetled, they are diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the removal; and the great root of this is Tythes, which tis clear for the Parſons ſake few regard; but the chief man favoured is the rich Impropriator; I pray, is not Tythes more due (according to the original ground of Tythes) to the Prieſt, then the Patron, or Lay-perſon; by the old Levitical analogie, then <hi>Hen.</hi> the Eights new policie? is the old inheritance in Parſon, Patron, and Ordinary, of leſs ſtrength, or leſs inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then that in the impropriator, who hath but upon grant upon a politike forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? or is it not evident to Reaſon by the rules of Scripture, Law, and Reaſon, that he is not capable of them?</p>
                  <p>He is not the labourer, not the Ox, not his lips that preſerves knowledge, not Gods Husbandman, and himſelf dares not own either Evangelical, Paſtoral, or Prieſtly Office; and it were well he practiſed but as an ordinary Chriſtian: but it is ſaid, the reaſon of all is Intereſt; for the light hath manifeſted Tythes no way due to the Goſpel, nor any certainty but a ſufficiency; yet this ſufficiency reſting in the arbitriment of the people, but theſe gathered into Churches, and the Church is then a Judge: Some from the inſpection of error, paſt, and preſent, that is, the general ungodlineſs which is in men, fear that Tythes put down, there would be no maintenance allowed, and the ſame confuſion would follow, as in <hi>Germany,</hi> the beſt Miniſter moſt contemned, therefore they are continued; this argument is agreed a principal motive to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue them.</p>
                  <p>But it is anſwered, That the ground-work is too weak; the Diſciple is not better then his Maſter, nor <hi>Englands</hi> Paſtor then the whole worlds Apoſtles; there is no command for it; why then enforced, and that to them who Preach not, Preach evilly; perſons not qualified according as the Goſpel holds out, either in the firſt of <hi>Timothy</hi> the third; or in the firſt of <hi>Tit.</hi> 9. but commonly all contrary.</p>
                  <p>Neither are the perſons qualified in the promiſcuouſneſs of Pariſhes as the brethren ought to be by the Word of God, yet theſe duties enforced; therefore ſay they, ſo long as theſe corrupt intereſts are, there can be no propagation of the Goſpel; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult not onely every Friday, but all the week; they agree the common liberty (which is the intereſt) is a great mercy of God, but if not ſorting with intereſt, if matters mend not, they fear intereſt may take away, as well as give liberty; they hope better, but in the fluctuations of matters they fear; let the cauſe of complaint be taken away, and they will count it their ſin to complain.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the Church ſo called generally as it was.</p>
                  <p>A ſhort view of the Commonwealth, and we will leave our Hiſtorical part.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the ſo called Parliament (as men commonly term it) a few onely exiſtent, the onely accuſed kept out (no further charge, no legal expulſion, nor new admiſſion, nor no way of ejecting members by their Repreſentors in caſe of failer of duty, as Non-attendance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They adviſe to remember how many went to the building the material Temple; therefore they would rather then eject, double the number) So that many Counties have no Repreſentatives admitted, others not appearing; and there being falſe principles in all eſtates, degrees, perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are jealous that our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators may not be wholly pure, eſpecially they having heard of the great ſtrife men make in Parliament for the advantage of the places for which they are choſen; and he is highlieſt accounted of, who benefits more his particular truſt, then the general good of the Nation: men may, as they have been, be carried away; they fear much, and therefore deſire a filling of the houſe by an equal Repreſentative, not deſirous at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of a new, to avoid ſome fatal evils that are foreſeen in the ſame.</p>
                  <p>In caſe of the Counſel of State, which they oppoſe not, they onely deſire it may be ſo limited, that it grow not from an Oligarchy into a Tyranny, which gives juſt cauſe of fear, while of Parliament men, and thoſe perpetual, and no power viſible to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they are not reſponſal for any wrong, and to put any into office with them, not Parliament men, and ſo reſponſal, except their brethren in power beat them out; there is injuſtice that one ſhould anſwer, another not for the ſame fault.</p>
                  <p>They rather deſire ſome fit way of choiſe, of one man out of every County in the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105181:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> Nation; from them come to Committees delays; the complaint now foreruns the new inſtituted Committee of Accompts; all Receivers, Treaſurers, Collectors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will have fine work, no Rule, Order, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but bare <hi>placet</hi> of <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Officers of Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will have the beſt ſhare of trouble, who have accounted in the County to the Sub-Committee of Sequeſtrations among themſelves to the Sub-committee of Accounts there; Now all muſt account at Goldſmiths Hall, and then to the new Catholike Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Accounts, as if Officers were but to drive a Trade of maintenance by whole ſale and retaile, from one ſhilling <hi>per</hi> pound to nine pence, then to ſix pence, then to four pence, three pence, two pence, one penny <hi>per</hi> pound; and that drawn out again in two, three, four, five, ſix, ſeven, eight, nine pence, <hi>&amp;c. per</hi> ſheet, to Writers, Clerks, Accountants, all after the form of the corrupt Commonwealth paſt.</p>
                  <p>There are honeſt men of all ſides ſay, That they fear no policy will prevail againſt truth, that is, they hope, though it be ſo feared; upon which they offer to confideration, whether it were ought but corrupt intereſt that made good men bad Biſhops? And whether it will not upon the ſame Rule make good men corrupt Officers of all ſorts; therefore they hate as much to hear of one ſhilling <hi>per</hi> pound, as of Patents during pleaſure; or to ſome for three years, while all are not ſo; and then not capable of ſo many years more; for the remote contingent dependance is evil, though not ſo evil as the more immediate and abſolute: Indeed there is a great complaint, that not onely things complained of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> remain ſtill the ſame, but grow worſe; Inns, Taverns and Alehouſes multiply, to the out daring Juſtice; irregularity in all Trades, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neglect of all inferior Powers in ordinary Juriſdiction; The orders iſſue, That all is left to be done according to Law; but that ſo dilatory and difficult, that no wiſe and honeſt man dare meddle with it, ſo that many faint and ſay, what they expected to be be the Lords deliverance is his Bondage; many while in the Wilderneſs, wiſh they were in <hi>Egypt</hi> again: there are that call for Kingly Government (as you well perceive.)</p>
                  <p>Yet were they the inſtruments to his overthrow, vain and impatient ſpirits; ſome rebell againſt you to make themſelves high, indeed like <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, for they ſay, What are you, that you ſhall raign over us?</p>
                  <p>Therefore they ſay, Let the old Race come in again, let not upſtarts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now theſe are the Lords Remembrancers to you; you are of the ſame frame and temper with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men; And you know mans condition ſince his fall, he hath ſhaken off the pure Law of Righteouſneſs, as an inſupportable Tyranny, and we are wholly led away of our own luſts, and <hi>Satan ſnares us under the notion of Liberty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus are we become mighty in miſchief, the devils policies are eaſily learned; but his ſtratagems difficulty, if at all, but by grace diſcovered; this makes us more ſubtile to deceive our ſelves then others; but God aſſuredly will not, cannot be mocked; this makes many fear mercies are given for a ſnare, that is, for future and greater Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (which the Lord prepare us for, if ſo determined; but if it be his gratious Will prevent by our returnings.)</p>
                  <p>By all which now it is evident, that the Apoſtacy and defection hath over ſpread both Churches and Nations; the people of God, as well as the men of the world; that this Apoſtacy hath been, yea is in <hi>England</hi> &amp;c ſtill working as vigorouſly, if not more then ever: Satan now rages, and the chaffer of the Whore is not yet expulſed the Camp of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>The ſtone hewn out of the Mountain without hands in the Regiment of the Lord Jeſus, hath been rejected as Chyliaſtical, a notion too obſtruſe in learned Scripture ſenſe, how plain ſo ever in the vulgar letter.</p>
                  <p>All that I ſay to them ſo reject it, yet look for Chriſts coming, is, let them take heed, that as the <hi>Jews</hi> eyes were blinded in looking for a Prince, and lo a Servant; That we be not blinded in ſtill looking at a Servant Chriſt when he will be exalted, leſt in ſtead of one we raiſe up many Antichriſts, and ſet them in the Seat of God.</p>
                  <p>I would not be miſtaken, I plainly mean with what limitations we intend the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to be the keeper of the Keys, which I fear can reſt in no mans hand but the Lord Chriſt's, let him have all the power the Pope, or Biſhop, or Clergy could claim.</p>
                  <p>But I ſay, the fellowſhips of Saints are freed from the enforcing power over conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>de Jure,</hi> though all evils (as well as ſins) may befall them with others for diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to unjuſt Laws <hi>de facto;</hi> You whom God hath called out to the work, have a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:105181:52"/> great task, be not found idling, or about other buſineſs, that you are ſecuring your great eſtates, or laying out your hundred thouſand pound in a ſetled way of lands; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be a weak anſwer at the great day of account. Give not occaſion to evil men to ſpeak evil of the Lords people, and of his wayes for lucre ſake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>England</hi> offers it ſelf as a white Paper to receive any Print; you need not at preſent out of fears of a change pretend a new Repreſentative to quiet ſpirits; No, the people are as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> feared enough with the thundrings, lightnings and Trumpet of quarterings, Sequeſtrations, and dilatory attendances, that they are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſpeak you like <hi>Moſes</hi> to God for them, and what he ſaith they will hear; there are ſome or other particulars ready to fly out, and ſay as <hi>Corah,</hi> Am not I as good as you, as wiſe, learned, vertuous, godly? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in impatience of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>But bleſſed be God, all the Congregation have not yet ſaid as they, You have ſlain the people of the Lord: We know, ſay ſome, the difficulty of the Work, if there were no oppoſition; how much muſt there then be where there is ſo much? ſit not ſtill, find time to ſettle leaſt God take you away; let's at leaſt ſee the fruits of your labours; and if you think it not yet the time of Chriſts perſonal, yet it be of his vertual Raign here; let there be a plain, ſure, certain, eaſie, ſettlement of affairs with that charitable affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that ſociable, ſuitable behaviour; that clearneſs, and that in ſimplicity which by the Laws of Nature is due to our fellow creatures.</p>
                  <p>Enforce unjuſt men to caſt away the maſque of hypocriſie in ſimulations of Piety and vertue, to gain advantage to ſavage gripings and extortions.</p>
                  <p>If you cannot allow the heights of the Goſpel-Liberty, allow us but a juſt ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the evident principles of natural equity, or ruled by (to avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts) the Moſaical Judicials as the boundary, or preſcribe your own way; this will admit ſatisfaction to many intereſts; and if rightly regulated, none in themſelves cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, elſe we deny our holy Profeſſion; <hi>For the grace of God that brings ſalvation unto all men hath appeared, And it teacheth us to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and that we ſhould live righteouſly, ſoberly and godly in this preſent life;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Looking for the bleſſed hope and appearing of the glory of the mighty God, who gave himſelf for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purge us to be a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to himſelf zealous of good works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now theſe good works are ſhortly laid down in the Goſpel thus, in obedience to Principalities and powers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that not onely Kings, but inferior Magiſtrates, yea Husbands, Parents, Maſters; yea, to Teachers, Elders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or any ſett over them, of, or in the Lord, taking care for all ſorts of perſons in the relations political, both Publike and Domeſtick; and alſo in ſpiritual: Its truth, the qualifications of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates under the Goſpel are not directly ſpoken unto in the Goſpel, which gives a ground to ſome to altercate, whether Magiſtracy may be under the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>But Generals may ſometimes be gathered from particulars; the principal ſcope tis true of the Goſpel ſhews the worlds enmity with the Spirit, and the ſpecial enmity reſts in the Princes; Powers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the men with their carnal intereſt.</p>
                  <p>But the Powers ſimply conſidered, cannot by that be oppoſed; for becauſe I will not admit an evil Magiſtrate that is a terror to the good, ſhall I not allow him that is a terror to the bad? becauſe it was a ſhame that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> went to Law before Heathen Judges, ſhall each one do what is right in his own eyes?</p>
                  <p>No; St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Let's not ſin that grace may abound, includes much; And ſo that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of an Elder of a Church; thoſe mental excellencies, ſoul-beautifyings of a ſpiritual Ruler; no Mitre, Crown, Bells, Pomegranates, Breaſt-plate, Ephod, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be allowed; no outward blemiſh; Though that was admitted among ſome Biſhops of the Primitive Church, is now juſt exception.</p>
                  <p>If ſuch purity in Elders for the Church, then ſurely alſo for the State: by this all the Typed Moſaical qualifications, and more alſo are required; Indeed, the words are mean and low; but the meaning is tranſcendent; I ſhall therefore ſhortly, according as the grace of God gives me, give a ſhort eſſay to the principles of a Chriſtian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and reſolve moſt of theſe Quaeries which here ſeem but barely controverted without determining.</p>
                  <p>I truely faint under the burden, knowing my own weakneſs, and the mighty wiſdom which I know in ſome, whom I cannot believe, think an alteration neceſſary, while they have accepted ſo great places of honor and profit, in what I muſt think wholly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105181:53"/> corrupt, and the world calls the prophane Commonwealth, or Babel in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; that is, they are feared principally to adore the Amuſive part of Juſtice in the formalities of Robes, as Judges Caps, Furrs, Blacks, Serjeants Gowns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſame with Rochets, Caps, Hoods, Gowns, Tippets, Surplices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So for Officers of Courts, ſo for Appeals, the ſame for dependances upon the Supream Magiſtrate in degrees by way of variety of Courts, Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in the Biſhops courſe, from the Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors and Arch-Deacons Courts to the High Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>So in the Presbyterian way, according to the courſe of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhional to the National Aſſembly; All which hath in it but a form of Juſtice, and is deluſory: neceſſaries I admit, but no more: I affect not the <hi>Laconick</hi> harſhneſs, nor the <hi>Stoical</hi> ſuperſtition, nor the <hi>Anabaptiſtical</hi> confuſion, nor the <hi>Perſian</hi> pomp and vanity.</p>
                  <p>Yet I think it was the more honor for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that they were learned, valorous, and free, though with little pomp or oſtentation, then to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> that they were pompous and bondſlaves; rich, but had nothing their own, cowardly and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, obedient even to ſhadows; an Ape or Hound of the Kings in the formality ſhould have ruled them as well as the King himſelf, for they were ignorant: I would therefore have Order to prevent confuſion; Obedience flow from Knowledge in civil things, as from Faith in divine, yet all for conſcience ſake; otherwiſe the Law will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go further then half way, and that will rule and perſwade where no Promoter or Officer of State can.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I ſay, pretending to a Chriſtian Commonwealth, I there explode all bare Forms, they are above them; neceſſary Forms are admitted, for they muſt be, but Forms of bare intereſt cannot, will not.</p>
                  <p>Happily you will ſay, This will put the Magiſtrate to a demur, whether then he ſhould have two Forms to govern by in the ſame Nation, but that Quaere will be uſeleſs.</p>
                  <p>For it is intended the Chriſtian Magiſtrate ſhould wave all thoſe Amuſions, and onely in the power of Righteouſneſs do Iuſtice, keep the Law of God with his whole heart, make it his ſtudy; and due execution of Law, and propagating the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it in an eaſie civil Chatechiſtical way will ſoon ſhew, that Form is a very Idol, no more then the Goddeſs Opinion; to which I fear not to ſay, they ſacrifice who ſo much exalt Form. Now know Forms are alſo in delayes; as not to give Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a plain Caſe of Law the ſame day it is complained of; it is Cuſtome not Form to weep lamentably upon the Bench at the giving ſentence of death, when this paſſion ariſes not from compunction of ſoul, but weakneſs of Spirit, and this weakneſs is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced by no care for ſoul after ſentence paſt.</p>
                  <p>It is then therefore ſuſpected to tend ſpecially to ſelf intereſt. Truly our ſweet Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Iuſtice are imbittered; we looked with the Prophet for Iuſtice, but its turned into mourning; for Righteouſneſs, but behold a Cry; the exceſſive Fees of all ſorts, the Selfiſh formal hearings, the dilatory attendances, the uſual ſqueeſing, griping Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as Underſheriffe, Baillffs, Regiſters, Clerks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all continued, whereby the poor is ſold for nothing, and Iuſtice at the rate of Cuſtoms, and Clerks Fees, which I nor no man can call a bribe.</p>
                  <p>O you that ſit in Seats of Iuſtice, beware; the Lord hath a controverſie with the mighty, and to pull down thoſe in his glory, he doth it in Iuſtice, and his Iudgements are true; good intentions ſo called, will not excuſe before him that ſearcheth hearts, yea to the dividing of ſoul and ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Know this you great men, if you ſeek to uphold any intereſt againſt the Lord, it will down; yea, your own hands ſhall work your own overthrow, you may have ſeen it in the mighty works of God hitherto; and if you will not perceive it by whom it is deſired, the merciful hand of God to you in correcting of others, he can ſoon lay the rod upon your ſhoulders alſo; and think not that becauſe God gave you long ſince to ſee this change, and then to ſeek him and his glory, and that he hath (if he hath) made you inſtrumental to him in this his work, or thereby, or hath given you places of honour or great profit at preſent, that therefore you are in the right, and under his protection.</p>
                  <p>No, then you muſt break every yoak, and pluck down every Idol, and labour to bow all intereſts, and powers, to be ſubject to the ſole Regiment of the Lord in truth and righteouſneſs, and in ſo doing, the grace of our Lord God will be with you, and guide you by his grace to glory.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:105181:53"/>
                  <p>O Lord, let the prayers of thy ſervants for this be heard of thee, and make all men through thy power to improve every place, talent, and opportunity to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy Truth in Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>There is now but one word concerning the Court of Chancery, which was the Court of equity for the Subject in general, as that of the ſo called Requeſts was in his proper nature for the relief of the Kings Servants upon any equitable matter ariſing within the verge of the Court, where at leaſt one party was to be the Kings menial Servant, however the pretended neceſſity of ſome, and reall of others abuſed it.</p>
                  <p>But that of the Requeſts gone, let us hear the opinions of men concerning that of the Chancery; and they ſay, that this Court of Conſcience is grown as unconſcion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as any; and the intereſt of profit to the particular Officers is as great and as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to publike good as of any Court, if not more; for ſuits in Chancery, are as common and as obnoxious as Writs of Error.</p>
                  <p>They ſay, the uſe of the Court is intentionally juſt, that is, that where accidents which could not be foreſeen nor avoided, caſts the right the contrary way to what the juſtice of the Law intended, that it ſhould be there remedied.</p>
                  <p>But they ſay, this ought firſt to appear at the Common Law, and then the whole matter tranſmitted from the Judges there to the Chancery, to be there decreed ſhortly.</p>
                  <p>Now the matters proper to that Court, can generally be manifeſted by no better an example then by thoſe for which a man is Eſſoinable at Common Law (upon duty of appearance, however that is made now a couſe of practice alſo, and Eſſoyns are of courſe, for the whole Law is perverted) whereas now men are toſſed from Common Law to Chancery, and then to Common Law again, and no end of Suit, and the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſo great, and iſſue ſo uncertain, that Free-Quarter was not more ruining then ſeeking right; for who can prefer a Bill under three pounds? and then for a Copy, the Defendant he muſt pay eight pence a ſheet, and ſix pence thereof goes to the ſo called Six Clerks for taking out the Bill, which are places valued at about two, ſome ſay ſix thouſand pounds a year; and if he can write, he ſets his name to it; examine it he ſhould; but it is not beleeved any one of them looks on one ſheet of a thouſand; and if he did, were it worth <hi>ob.</hi> to read it, if but two pence to write it? Take a Copy from the Plaintif you cannot, though he would ſo favour you; you cannot put in your Anſwer till that due be paid.</p>
                  <p>After the Anſwer, cometh an Injunction that muſt be moved for; there is ten, if not twenty, thirty, fourty ſhillings oft, three pounds in eminent Caſes, and to eminent men, that is, one great in power, as in Offices of Honor, or highly favoured: This Injunction comes to eighteen ſhillings; why not for one ſhilling all of courſe? I have ſeen Orders made by thoſe honorable men now ſitting tending to it; but By-practizers hear they are detrimental to private profit, and ſo the Orders are abroad to catch birds to the lure. You may now ſue at a better rate, the Court hath reformed; but come to try, and you muſt pay as before.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Six Clerks are wholly needleſs; the Regiſter alone can do the work; but particular Judges, Keepers, &amp;c. muſt not make theſe orders in any Court, they will be overballanced, or may be; for generally they have been.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be enacted into a Law, That the Subject may require it as his due, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and have, not only redreſs, but ſatisfaction; References to the pretended Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are worſe, as more dilatory, but ought not to be ſo expenſive, by reaſon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ought to take but half a Crown.</p>
                  <p>Now I like that Maſter beſt that will clearly ſay, I have viewed all, and ſee the right, and will report it, you ſee my great trouble and pains, you know my due is but two ſhillings ſix pence, I will do you right; for my recompence I leave it to you as you are a Gentleman.</p>
                  <p>Too little wages is a wrong and a ſnare to any ſervant, much more a publick one, and moſt to a judicial one, or inſtrumentall thereto; all ears hear complaints; but I who cannot accuſe, will not charge, though I may beleeve there is ſome fire where there is ſo much ſmoak.</p>
                  <p>I will reckon up no more of the Six Clerks tricks to the perplexity of the practizing Clerk, and detriment of the Clyent; this alone is enough.</p>
                  <p>Nor will I alledge ought more for the Court, then that old Rule of the Learned,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:105181:54"/> which none but the Learned can underſtand; There is no remedy in the Chancery for what there is no remedy at Common Law. But now, for poor people not worth ten pounds in the world, quiet perſons, to be ſued by contentious knaves, how ſhall they bear the charge? for though that the Subject Defendant is (contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs rule of Law) admitted of courſe to take out a <hi>Dedimus,</hi> whereby their journey to <hi>London</hi> is ſaved, yet when they come but to take out the Bill at eight pence <hi>per</hi> ſheet, before they can take a <hi>Dedimus,</hi> and next pay after the rate of eight pence a ſheet again for writing the Bill in the <hi>Dedimus,</hi> which alone is the evident great gain of the practizing Clerk, half the eſtate of the party is gone.</p>
                  <p>O the intolerable oppreſſion that is amongſt Chriſtians! I fear all the Turks and Heathens in the world will not own ſo much; I admire not, if any height of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be objected to a Turk, his deteſtation of it is expreſſed thus (Do you think me to be a Chriſtian?)</p>
                  <p>The ſharking of the Subject by feigned recoveries, and by the great ado to releaſe womens eſtates, at ſuch chargeable rates, only to maintain a company of idle bellies, and nouriſh corrupt dependencies, is of a like ſtrain.</p>
                  <p>And though the Verdict by twelve men be accounted the chief flower, or one of the chiefeſt in the Garland of <hi>Englands</hi> Liberties; yet I muſt ſay the baſeneſs of men is ſuch, that it is one of the moſt deſtructive; for there is no conſcience of an oath with the moſt; and though it be viſible, there is no due puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, you that are at the Stern, whom God hath lifted up in the height of his power, and placed in ſeats of Eminency, do not trifle away your precious time, let ſpeedy care be taken to ſettle this poor diſtracted Nation; look not to your own works, and let the Lords lie ſtill; there appeared in you a ſtrong dependance upon God; give not wicked men cauſe to blaſpheme; Rowze up your ſelves, and conſider God hath a controverſie with the Nation, and will not be appeaſed with all Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, except Juſtice and Righteouſneſs be done.</p>
                  <p>Let the Complaints of the poor, afflicted, diſtreſſed come to your ears, who have great wrongs, injuries, and oppreſſions, and none to relieve them.</p>
                  <p>Yea, let the cryes of quiet peaceable men come to your ears, who are oppreſſed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe not willing to return evil for evil, rayling for rayling, ſtroak for ſtroak, action for action:</p>
                  <p>To ſue, is to perplex their minds, ruine their eſtates, if they have it, and bring them at leaſt to a wanting condition, who lived well; not to ſue, to be ſued and forced to compound at the legal Theeves Will.</p>
                  <p>If poor, the Law is chargeable, equity unreaſonable, and get a Lord Chief Juſtice (Warrant ſo called) Order of Reference, it is derided, not obeyed, after much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, loſs of time, and ſome expence by the poor Sutor.</p>
                  <p>You are on earth in Gods place, and muſt to him give an account; let not your eyes ſleep till theſe works of Righteouſneſs be ſetled.</p>
                  <p>There is great complaint of Inns, Alehouſes, Taverns, &amp;c. encreaſing under your Regiment; for the Lords ſake look ſpeedily about you, let not your Officers, as the Kings, ſet your honor to ſale for the increaſe of their Fees; you are yet in a ſlippery place; the promiſes and engagements upon you are great, and the expectations of the people high; and thoſe moſt conſiderable of your own party, are the higheſt; their ſpirits breath after juſt Liberty, they ſee how you toſs and tumble all the Rubbiſh of the Government of the world, to find fit ſtones for your building; Truly, they dare ſay, among all the Chriſtian Princes, practiſed Rules, Edicts, Orders; Statutes, Laws, &amp;c. you cannot find materials enough to lay one ſtep to the Throne of pure Juſtice, in the ſupremacy of power; and they therefore much fear leſt you ſhould ſtumble at the ſame ſtone of offence with them, and place the excellency of your eminency in power to do, rather then doing Juſtice; and when you get a little ſtrength, to ſtand on your ſelves, to think, and by power make good, you are as they accountable to none but God; there is no clearneſs in the walkings and actings of men, becauſe yours are not ſo.</p>
                  <p>But moſt will hope as they pray, for better things; and although they knowing the great burthens which are upon your ſhoulders, cannot deſire ſo much as ſome do, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they, nor dare they (as others) think, much leſs ſay (moſt likely to render your actions odious) that you ſeek nothing but your ſelves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:105181:54"/> you do not all that is deſired, therefore cry out, you ſit to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>No, all may ſee you have done great things; but it is deſired, that ſome things of conceived neceſſity for your eſtabliſhment be ſpeedily ordered, until with the whole they may be in due time eſtabliſhed or ſetled.</p>
                  <p>As firſt for the breeding up of all youth, that all Schools be ſupplyed with able, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and religious School-maſters, all according to one form and rule ſetled by the Supream Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>And ſo the Univerſities, where the youth are yet rather poyſoned then profited; and though the humerous conceit of Caps and Capping, and ſuch like be juſtly waved, that ſuch a decency be ordered in the habits of youths, as may not adapt the mind to licentiouſneſs (many wiſe men placing much in things of that nature) and to that end that all youths habits (of both ſexes) at leaſt may be ordered throughout the whole Nation, but eſpecially apprentices and ſervants of all ſorts.</p>
                  <p>So as at leaſt to diſtinguiſh, not ſhame; that of ſhame only affronting, not reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and for all ſervants to be admitted their ſervices by Teſtimonial under a penalty to the Maſter or Dame; their wages to be ſet by the Magiſtrate; or ſome appointed univerſality and abſolute conformity in theſe even to unity may be preſſed without juſt ſcruple of conſcience.</p>
                  <p>For to ſpeak once for all, to make acts of common reaſon, intendment, and benefit for particular places by them in ſupremacy of power, becauſe by them asked, and not by others, is exceeding ſelfiſh, which who ever hath purchaſed out a particular act can eaſily reſent.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is juſtly deſired ſuch things to be generally the ſame; For prohibiting of new Inns, Taverns, &amp;c. and ouſting thoſe erected within ſeven or ten years, unleſs allowed by your Commiſſioners, and upon due and ſet cauſe to diſable the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and allow others, or fine to ſome purpoſe, as receiving any to tipple on the Lords Day, or dayes of publike either prayer or humiliation.</p>
                  <p>And that all things may hold a proportion, that all Offices Honorary, fiduciary, or profitable be ſo diſtributed, that the work intended may be done, or the neglecters puniſhed; and that ſuch as are faithful, may know certainly to whom to make their addreſſes; for many errors are ſeen and felt, and the State is ſenſible of them in part, as by the careful Orders iſſued out from the Right Honorable the Councel of State appears.</p>
                  <p>But how to execute them, and not be caught in the witty ſpringes of our preſent Cabaliſtical Law, no Juſtice of Peace can determine; and generally the more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and able, the more wary, at leaſt in opening of the fruitleſs, or rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructively fruitful niceties paſt, whereby the many are cooled to action.</p>
                  <p>For if they apprehend men dangerous, That live high, and yet can give no account how they come by it; what ſhould they do? To impriſon for no cauſe viſible, is hard to ſome; not to do it, deſtructive with others; to priſon in the Gaole, charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and the place having no labor to buſie body or mind, fatall; in <hi>Bridewell,</hi> ſhameful; and generally work they will not, and all this from the want of due Law.</p>
                  <p>Next, our Lawyers are eminently favourers of nicety of Law, and open it to the ruine of publick ſafety; for from an opinion that Lead is parcel of the free-hold of the Church, to rob all Churches ſo called, is ſo frequent, that it is feared they will ſoon come to pull down houſes: No, ſaith the Learned, ſue him, and he hath nought to recompence the ſame; ſo there muſt be viſible actuall force with Guns, &amp;c. to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence a forcible detainer, or the indictment lies not, whereby poſſeſſions are kept oft times ten years together, many ſeven; ſue they dare not, the Law is ſo nice, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious and chargeable; this is deſtroying property in honeſt <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for cutting up young Timber, felling young ſtands, underwood, and the like, with many other wrongs, no law, no remedy evident or practiſed.</p>
                  <p>Alter but the Law of hanging for Felony, and this and a thouſand things will the learned make Felony ſtreight, if you give but two-fold reſtitution or ſervitude for a ſet time to be by you appointed.</p>
                  <p>But eſpecially look to give ſpeedier Law in the proper places, to at leaſt the poor,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:105181:55"/> or ſmall matters; it is neceſſary to Commiſſionate ſome for the ſpeciall Counties, and that to determine all ſuits both in Law and equity; the want of this is the main root of growing poverty; and that upon Petition, without formalities of Bill, and Anſwer, Declaration and Plea; give a ſtop to curſory Writes of Error, and regulate executions; for under Sheriffs and their Officers have need of it, if any.</p>
                  <p>I love the Reaſon of our Laws, and am as much againſt Tyranny, or pure Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government, as any man; I honor the learned and upright Lawyer, and would have vertue, learning, yea and ſervice in all due Offices ſhould be regarded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded; I allow the neceſſary dependances of inferiours in all ranks upon the ſupream or abſolute powers reſpectively; it is but the unneceſſary, fruitleſs, or deſtructive intereſts that are oppoſed, which every juſt man will ſtand for both with life and eſtate.</p>
                  <p>And by you, Right Honorable, in your proſecutions thereof, let no private reſpect take you off; it is not only reaſon, but neceſſity calls to you for it; therefore on in the excellency of ſtrength; fear not a claſh with any corrupt intereſts whatſoever; onely what is juſt, let it be done juſtly; it is the eminencie of Vertue alone can make your enemies hearts yours, though power may conquer their perſons.</p>
                  <p>By this time it is time to winde up my Clue of Hiſtory, wherein I profeſs in the preſence of God, I have to the utmoſt of my skill and knowledge, waved all bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and what ever might juſtly give occaſion of offence.</p>
                  <p>I yet know ſome will be taken by men of all tempers; I, nor no man that will ſpeak truths in ſuch a ſeaſon of intereſts, can expect to pleaſe all, if it be hardly poſſible at any time; I ſhall as God ſhall enable me, go on (the aſsiſtance of whoſe gracious Spirit I humbly crave) and hold forth what the Law of pure reaſon, agreeable to the divine word hath eſtabliſhed to be the Rule for the exerciſe of Juſtice and of Righteouſneſs among Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>But ſome will expect, that I ſhould ſpeak one word to our ſo much pleaded boundaries to Preregative and Rule of Priviledge, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> ſo called, and the Petition of Right, more then what hath been ſaid. I ſuppoſe needleſs to ſhew that they reſpectively in their ſeaſons were but the beginnings of that freedome which the Subjects of thoſe times breathed after; they are to us, or were before theſe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions brake out, but the reducing, as I may ſay, of ſpeculative or notional Liberty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a way of practicall or real Freedome; for what was before only in the breaſt of the Judge, was now in Engliſh letters made obvious to each mans ſenſe, ſo that they after pleaded that Letter againſt any contrary walkings, whether in the King or his Officers.</p>
                  <p>So that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is not pleaded as the utmoſt due of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subject, nor the Petition of Right, but as thoſe things which are ſo eſſentiall in the generalty to any Nation, that even the Kings muſt afford them, or they are not juſt.</p>
                  <p>And the Rulers muſt act accordingly, or they are betrayers of Truſt.</p>
                  <p>And if it be impartially diſcuſſed, it will appear that the private intereſt of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or the power intruſted for publick benefit abuſed for ſelf-ends, hath been the ground of the principal oppoſition to Prices; for where hath the exceſs of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or ſtretching the Law for publick benefit, or honor of the Nation, or againſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick viſible offendors been impugned? no, the lives of many Citizens, and the confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their eſtates, not to ſpeak of taxes, or reſtraint of Liberty, have been by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralty praiſed and allowed, though ſome prudent one might Stoically out of the fore-ſight of miſ-improving theſe preſidents by evill men diſallow ſuch Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                  <p>If a free-ſpirited underſtanding Engliſhman look upon the firſt Chapter of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> unleſs enforced through neceſsity to make uſe of any ſhaft to wound an Adverſary, yea, though it flyes in his own face and wounds him, what will he ſay to it? for after the freedome granted to the ſo called Church, the Preface or Aſſumption on the Kings part, is, That he having God before his eyes, for the ſalvation of his own ſoul, and the ſouls of his Predeceſſors and Succeſſors, of his own free will did give and grant, &amp;c. the Liberties following to be holden of him, his Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:105181:55"/>
                  <p>And theſe Liberties are there called Franchiſes, which intimates the Kings gave them the freedoms there ſet down now, who before had none; and let any unintereſted man look upon them, and he will ſee they indeed hold a reaſon of policy, but ſtill ſubſervient to the firſt ſettlement of the Baſtard <hi>William;</hi> there are many notable juſt things in it; and ſurely ſuch as by which the people were judged before the Charter granted; but the people not having ought aſſured, and before the power of the King, the intereſt of Nobles, the corruption of Iudges, other matters rendring the Law then wholly incertain, they ſought this to clear up and aſſure their right, as far as might be; for Iuſtice ought to be like as the Elements are by the firſt intention, wholly free.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the true underſtanding wiſe man ſaith, That he inforces not <hi>Magna Charta</hi> as the boundary to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws, or juſt Freedom, or Chriſtian Liberty, but as a Catalogue of ſuch immunities as were granted by the Kings to the Subjects formerly, according to the then light the Nation had to ask, and power to inforce; for ſo they were pleaded by the Grantor, many of which are now wholly ceaſed by time, others have been altered, ſome enlarged by ſubſequent judgements ſo called, and Statutes; and it is evident, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> now long and thirſt after a rational ſetled Law in all the parts in the whole body, taking the Law of God for the Rule, as the Charter-Grantor did, though the face of man was the viſible Engine to draw the pleaſant ſtreams of Liberty out of the Ocean of Royal Power; and although that ſucceeding Princes did never keep the Law wholly, yet it was alwayes evident, that a noble Prince that ſought not himſelf ſo much as the glory of the Nation, the Acts of ſuch a one were ſeldom, if at all queſtioned: So that to give ſatisfaction according to the deep and often reiterated Engagements of the Nation, it is requiſite that ſome ſele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, impartial, honeſt, underſtanding, Religious Patriots be ſet apart as a Committee wholly to attend the collecting of a body of Law, out of all Laws, making Gods Word at leaſt generally, or the Moral Judicial, that is, that which in point of Reaſon is equal and juſt to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> or <hi>Egyptian</hi> as to the <hi>Jew,</hi> to whom yet an <hi>Hebrew</hi> was an abomination; Now it is worthy ſerious conſideration who to imploy in this work; to imploy Lawyers, is to give no ſatisfaction to the people, jealous of theſe men whoſe intereſt depends ſo ſpecially thereon; not to uſe them, is to ſtir up the prime men of parts, and of vaſt revenues to a conteſt of great importance, and ſome think not of evident neceſſity; for there are many wiſe, juſt, and outwardly religious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; out of <hi>Englands</hi> Law-Books its deſired it ſhould come, the head Rule of Gods Word, and Truth preſerved ſtill in the eminency of Power, and then let the Rule of juſt and good be by ſuch of them as you ſhall appoint, and ſuch others as you ſhall chuſe to commiſſionate with them, drawn out of thoſe deep fountains of Wiſdom (then which none are more excellent generally, nor more divinely rational) and laid open to the view of each one to judge.</p>
                  <p>I ſhal give you but one example; we all agree that the civil Law here raigned original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by it the next of kin, whether of fathers ſide or mothers to whom the inheritance did by Law deſcend, was Guardian of the Infant. The Law of <hi>England</hi> now is, the next of kin to whom the inheritance cannot diſcend, is Guardian; the reaſon of the Civil Law was, becauſe alliance of bloud was the bond of Love, and who would take greater care? but this Law of Nature was found to be moſt unnatural; many (by accidental paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, being corrupted for pride, covetize or envy ſake) brake the bonds of Nature; and, for the inheritance ſake became the murderers, or inſtrumental to the murder, death or captivity of ſuch infants, thereby to keep the eſtate for ever, or gain to themſelves the eſtate and inheritance, ſaying, this is the heir, let us kill him, and the Inheritance ſhall be ours; ſo that it is evident, Supremacy of Reaſon bare ſway, but the reaſon is founded upon the divine Rule; but look at other caſes, which are divers, and the reaſon divers, and yet all hold force in Law, and that for good reaſon ſake.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, The Law gives in ſome, and moſt places, all the Land to the eldeſt; and the reaſon is, becauſe he is thereby enabled to give greater aſſiſtance to the King in his wars with horſe of ſervice, as <hi>William</hi> the Baſtard plotted.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Kent,</hi> there the land is diviſible equally among all, becauſe all ſtand in equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the father: and where the Cuſtome is, its Law at this day.</p>
                  <p>A third rule is <hi>Borough Engliſh;</hi> there the younger ſon had all the Land, as leaſt able
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105181:56"/> to maintain himſelf; there were no great evils found in theſe, &amp; therefore theſe all ſtand; but its believed by moſt, that were a double portion given to the eldeſt and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it might be the ground of a better ſettlement then this Nation ever had, who it is agreed did never yet ſubmit to that Law. It cannot be denied, but that it will take off much from the vaſtneſs of eſtate, which is now ofttimes for many generations conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the ſtock of noble Anceſtors; but tis anſwered, That it will keep from the Gallows, and other places as infamous and more miſerable, many noble and gallant Sprouts and Syences of Royal ſtocks, who (having (as it oft falls out) more active and ingenious ſpirits then the Elder brother, and) brought up by the indulgent Parent, according to the rank and quality of his father, he dead, and either none, or a ſmall portion no way equal to his breeding, but infinitely ſhort of his birth, as he calls it, or of his ſpirit left him, he being before fired with ambition, is now madded with envy, and in a kinde of deſperation, puts himſelf upon looſeneſs and villanies to ſupport his indigency.</p>
                  <p>This Law hath therefore much need to be ſeriouſly conſidered, as alſo that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eſtate in Tayl and Feoffments upon condition.</p>
                  <p>Tis ageed, none will be more able then the religious Lawyer in this part; but as to the ſetling of Courts, Fines, Officers Fees, Times of Trial, Proceſs, Execution, and the like, its conceived wholly unfit to have Judge or Lawyer impowred, if holding places of profit actually, or pactiſing in any Court under a Fee; for the Nation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains not ſo much of the Law of property and right and wrong, as in the diſcipline or execution of the Law; its found to be corrupt intereſt that troubles both Church ſo called and Commonwealth; therefore in this let Lawyers object, but others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, and that according to a Rule of righteouſneſs, namely for Juſtice ſake, not to maintain intereſt, as hitherto the puny Clerks and unfavored Lawyer, and young Attorny, and heretofore ſome puny Iudges would be content with Reformation, for they could not be worſed by the bargain; No, tis thoſe Officers that have places from four or five hundred, to ten or twenty thouſand <hi>per annum,</hi> that are loth to be drawn to the Standard of Iuſtice: Tis this and the like caſts odiums upon juſt things under the name of Levelling, deſtroyers of property, deſpiſers of Governments, haters of Order, projectors for Anarchy, enemies to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that is, the Supream Magiſtrate; we have ſeen, and moſt do believe, that many no way affecting Reformation, have held forth juſt things only to deceive and delude, and lull the State aſleep, untill they were fit for their deſign. But theſe alſo admire that the State do not theſe juſt things, to take away the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of ſuch mens aſperſions, and mutinous clamorous, and hinder others from being drawn into ſuch Toyls by too eaſie credulity, while they after renewed complaints finde no amendments; they hear and liſten day after day, and moneth after moneth, but there's no end of their expectation; God hath changed, and changed, and changed again, but their bondage is they ſay the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Tis moſt true, tis not poſſible to pleaſe every pallat, eſpecially when each pallat hath moſt viſibly a diſguſt; we are faln into many pieces; God hath taken us, and daſhed us one againſt another; yea now the Evil is come to that paſs, that the wound of carnality is moſt evident in the Envyings of Profeſſors: O what bitter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity among thoſe call themſelves the people of God! and though Diſcipline be pretended, its evident the root is Government, the high-gate of Preferment, eminency of Power, multitudes of followers, and the like. Brethren, is this of Chriſt? Is this according to his Rule? He that will rule, let him be ſervant to all.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but apply to ſuch heady ones, that of <hi>Feſtus</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> without cauſe, to you with cauſe; <hi>The knowledge of the world hath beguiled you;</hi> You deceive your ſelves and others, while you contemn all men but your ſelves; and all judgement that agrees not with your opinions. Where is the Image of God? Look upon the Magiſtrate, by what names or titles ſo ever diſtinguiſhed, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute not the judgement of God, but of themſelves; they rule to ſatisfie their luſt; they glory in outward power, riches, honor, and the like; the great men, both thoſe that are mighty through wiſdom, as the learned Lawyer, Phiſitian, Divine; mighty in ſtrength, as the Commander in war, Military Power; or the Magiſtrate from the higheſt Iudge to the loweſt Conſtable, who are cloathed with civil power,
<pb facs="tcp:105181:56"/> all as the Supream in Truſt do lead, follow the dance of eying the ſplendors and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the world; and can we think that the multitude will not follow?</p>
                  <p>O all you mighty men, What hath made you thus haſte to deſtruction? What was it that by degrees made poſſible, what confidently none of you could once think on, the executing of a King in the chief City of his Realm? what made you ſeek a change? and what prepared the way to the Iudgement which God had appointed? was it not Self-ſeeking? was it not raigning for Self? was it not Oppreſſion in Iuſtice? was it not altering the end of the Law, more then the Law it ſelf, though that was laid to his charge, as fitteſt to draw the people to a ſenſible intereſt?</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that came in place after, what was it rendred them obnoxious to change? was it not driving on the ſame trade? and moſt aſſuredly it will in Gods Jnquiſition for righteouſneſs and Iudgement, ruine all that ſhall tread the ſame path; you cannot wholly ruine the native Liberty.</p>
                  <p>I avow to have after a total expulſion of the Kings Power, and ſetling an other by your onely viſible Power, ſubmitted to the Engamement, to be true and faithful to the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. I by this acknowledge my ſelf bound in my Place and Station to be actively to you, untill as fully ſubdued, while at liberty; but if under the Sword of your Adverſary, I muſt ſubmit unto the force, and not act againſt them, not you; this the Law of Nature teaches, the Law of beſt and Supream Reaſon; further you cannot expect, no nor your enemy, unleſs you will be Tyrants; and this either of you may require. I allow not of ſeditious words, writings, or deeds. I onely ſay, Give the liberty you would take; ſure none but evil Magiſtrates ever would diſallow a liberty to complain; ſome ſay tis all that is left them: But I ſhall deſiſt from ſuch enlargements, and ſpeak onely upon ſome few matters ariſing in the Verge of my truſt, I am bound by a neceſſity to declare the evils of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Concerning the Tax for the Army; It hath, as to its great and unjuſt inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity been long complained of; for ſome paid but two pence <hi>per</hi> pound; that is the rate came to two pence <hi>per</hi> pound in thoſe parts, and they gave in but half value of their lands, as twenty: True value was rated at ten; and no more, if ſo much; and the Towns adjacent were at full value, one ſhilling two pence <hi>per</hi> pound: yea, ſome in other places one ſhilling ten pence; ſo that in the higheſt rates to the E. of <hi>Mancheſter, Britiſh</hi> Army, <hi>Newark,</hi> the Garriſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the poor owner, and ſome rich ones did freely offer their whole Revenues to diſcharge Taxes. This burthen was long laboured againſt; after this comes an Act for an equal pound rate; this by them who had good bargains was oppoſed and delayed; ſo that the Armies neceſſities enforced a return to the old way of error; Some juſt men renew this work more rigorouſly, and an Act comes down for ſix months, beginning at 25. of <hi>Decem.</hi> laſt; the Act comes ſo late that its not poſsible to act towards the firſt three moneths; and that there might not be ſuch delayes and evils as had faln out upon the former three months, which gave no power to the Commiſsioners to act otherwiſe then by a pound rate; ſo that many feared Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munires; this gave ſuch a power in caſe of not being able to compaſs the work in due time, to return back again. The buſineſs of the ſecond three months was not thought fit to be put on foot till the firſt three moneths were ended, when the time comes, the old Oppoſers are the new Oppoſers, and plead ſeveral pleas, which will inlighten much to the truth of what is before Hiſtorized. The main objections were three or four; firſt, It was Levelling, and that it was as juſt to reduce all mens eſtates to an equality, as the rates after ſo long continuance; this a grave and wiſe man otherwiſe, ſtrenuouſly aſſerted. The ſecond was, It was an obſtruction to the ſervice of the State; for alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Cuſtomary Rates would be long in ſettling, &amp; the monies would not come in, and then the Souldier would return to free quarter; and the next, The Garriſon of <hi>Lin</hi> were earneſt not to alter, fearing, as they ſaid, That they that took free-quarter, when it was not due, and more then was due, would out-do Reaſon if really behind. The laſt was, when we had done what we could, we could not make a truly perfect Rate: There was a fourth, but little to the purpoſe; and that was, we knew not what nor how to rate, and ſo we might over-rate as well as under-rate, and for that we had no power. To the firſt it was anſwered, That a rule of Juſtice was deſired, not equalling eſtates, but equal rating of them, the beſt way to quiet ſpirits from thoughts of unjuſt Levelling. To the ſecond, That it obſtructed not the ſervice to alter the rates from evil to good; the ſouldier ſhould have his money, and would but each one lend their helping hand, as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105181:57"/> ſoon as in the old way, and to avoid raiſing more, they would raiſe leſs, and then rate a new, as the Act ordered; but if obſtructing Service would bear a rate abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to an Act before, that reaſon would allow a little over rating now; and the rather becauſe it ſhould truly eaſe the next Aſſeſsment, the Accompter would appear, and no evil done. To the third, it was ſaid, That the evil unjuſt rate had continued ſeven years, and no remedy, as unjuſt as at firſt, and muſt be ſo for ever; for the rule was to rate as formerly.</p>
                  <p>This was now provided for, and what was now pleaded, That the Parliament did not intend any alteration, for alteration could not be without obſtruction: Thus Self makes uſe of all weapons for her advantage; and were it poſsible to truſt men in chief places not ſo ſelfiſh, or that thoſe in Supremacy were ſo clear that right might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, we ſhould ſoon ſee an alteration.</p>
                  <p>The next thing which I hold my ſelf bound to give notice to the Nation of, is, The Aſsizes for <hi>Norfolk</hi> were according to evil Cuſtome, if there be ſo much in it, kept at <hi>Thetford</hi> on the brink of the River parting <hi>Norfolk</hi> &amp; <hi>Suffolk;</hi> the uſe ariſing from the High-Sheriffs heretofore ſerving for both Counties, it having no priſon fit to receive the multitude of priſoners in <hi>Norwich</hi> Caſtle, being as <hi>per</hi> Calender 144. The civil part was there only determined, and not the criminal. Now I ſhal omit to ſpeak of the abundance of forfeitures by this means, though falling much upon the poor, it helps forward the neceſsity of Levellers in the groſſeſt acceptation, by reducing them to abſolute beggery; I ſhall onely ſpeak of the triall of the Gaol, which will hint matters of ſome concernment. Firſt, there was a Commiſsion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer;</hi> next, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of the Peace; Theſe Commiſsions are not ſetled by Act of Parliament in the County, but are a part of Prerogative, and grantable at pleaſure of the Supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie. Now there were many Priſoners which were bound over to the next Goal-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery; theſe the learned in the Law upon mature deliberation, and after great adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, reſolve they cannot try: conſider the reaſons which I muſt own Legally, of great weight, but hear them; by the Commiſsion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter.</hi> they could not be heard, for the Recognizance was onely at Gaol-delivery, therefore they could not be called by the Commiſsion of the Peace; they could not try them, for the Seſsions of the Peace had before referred them to the trial of a Superior Judge (of courſe) for difficulty of the matter: but if was agreed that had a Commiſsion of Gaol-delivery come, the ſame men without a Superior Judge, or more skill or knowledge in the Law then they had before, would have tried them. Is not Form the Idol of the world? I appeal to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream power for the priviledg of the Nation, and beſeech them that the due rights of a Free Nation may be eſtabliſhed in ſetled Judicatories in the Nation. Here alſo fell out another Quaere at this great Seſsions, namely, what to do in caſe of an Under-Sheriff, who ſhould execute his Office beyond his year; contrary to the Statute we found this. The High-Sheriff of the County (as uſually before, to the great prejudice of the people of the Nation under the late King) did make a bargain with an Attorney, to be, or find one to be for him, ſuch a one as he would undertake for his Under-Sheriff. This man contracts with the Kings Sheriff accordingly, and himſelf and his ſon (a young boy, as the Juſtices upon view judged him of about eighteen years of age) execute the Office, both at the laſt Aſsizes and this Seſsions, and the intervals, not having taken any Oath; it was demanded of the boy, who was Under-Sheriff? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, his father, but his name was uſed; he was tried by the Juſtices to read a precept, he could not do it; ſo for double diſability, he was diſallowed by the generalty of the Juſtices; by this practiſe if the Father were Under-Sheriff, he loſt two hundred pound by the Statute for this year, and two hundred pound more for a year before; for it is ſaid he hath ſerved now three years, and I beleeve unſworn all the time, if due inquiry were made.</p>
                  <p>Next, the ſon forfeits 40. pound for executing without Oath, yea though unfit; but notwithſtanding all this, two Juſtices of the Peace preſent at the debate, do the next day ſwear this Boy, thereby ſure intending to intricate the buſineſs, and give the Father leave to plead againſt his Forfeiture of 200. pound, or queſtion for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting the Office unſworn.</p>
                  <p>I ſay no more, but I think they deſerve a Fine above his, beſides forfeiture of their Truſts, and the rather becauſe the mans integrity, and ſo fitneſs for the Office, is as much queſtioned as any mans in <hi>Norfolk.</hi> Gent. To ſue for this in the Travailes, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes, Delayes, Tortures of the Law, who will?</p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:105181:57"/>
                  <p>You are the Fathers of the Family, if you pleaſe to take this notice according to your Truſts who are in the places of Eminency and Supream Power in the Nation, from a ſon, a brother, a Citizen of the Commonwealth, do; if not, I have ſatisfied my Conſcience, the evil lies at your door, if you think as they who have gone before you have done, to ſalve all with The Law is open, 'Tis begging the queſtion:</p>
                  <p>We ſay, the door was never ſo faſt ſhut as now, either in the ſetled Law Courts in Ordinary, or new ones of Committees; for, though the doors be open, that is, there is eaſie beginning ſuits, that is, it is eaſie to complain; yet the journey is great from the remoteneſs of places; and in Committees 'tis ſo difficult to get them together; in the other Courts there is ſo much buſineſs, that there are ſo many obſtructions to right, eſpecially of poor men, or quiet ſpirits; and eſpecially, the men of Law are ſo favoured, that there is a dead heart in all men to ſeek Reformation. Remedy this, and you will finde complainers enow.</p>
                  <p>But if a great man now be complained of for juſt things, as have been offered to be avowed upon Oath, yet rather then ſtand the ſhock of a ſuit, the wiſe mans Councel in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> is the poor mans comfort, <hi>Go not to ſuit with him that is too mighty for thee;</hi> compound with him is the way, though he requires all thy ſubſtance as too little to ſatisfie his wronged honour, brought into queſtion, ſuch a one as he ſcandalized, though all his friends know the truth of the caſe, how wiſely ſoever carried, that is legally, avoiding the reach of the practical (Law ſo called.)</p>
                  <p>I know no truly wiſe and prudent man deſires a meaſure exactly juſt, that is, ſuch as againſt which no objection will lie; no ſurely, if there be ſuch bad Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, there will be evil men; what is deſired, is not only poſſible, but feaſable, were there but juſt endeavours after it; were not the diverſions ſo viſible, it were tolerable; but when its well known, that all eyes are upon you, when all engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Artifices which the Religion held forth, or prudence at beſt ſuggeſt, have been not only proffered, but penally enforced, what but a ſeared conſcience will not relent, or a nealed face bluſh?</p>
                  <p>Former ſervices do not acquit latter offences; the inſtances of the elder of the <hi>Horatii, Manlius</hi> and other among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and multitudes of other in other places, evidence.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt and mightieſt Princes are ſubject to the ſame proportionable chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with their meaneſt Subjects; and the Subject hath this advantage, he is beſt able to bear it.</p>
                  <p>Our evil hath grown from lenity; our remedy muſt be at leaſt neceſſary ſeverity; and if you be not guilty, you may uſe it freely; 'Tis offendors cry out ſo ſternly for mercy; you are now by true intereſt and obligation, to labour a well grounded peace to this; the occaſions of publique diſguſt muſt be firſt taken away. Remember natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and rational Priviledge, the clearing of intereſted Dependancies; take them away, they are viſible and viſibly known.</p>
                  <p>Next, ſettle ſuch plain and evidently rational Laws and proceedings; as may aſſure Juſtice in the end, and that Common and Univerſal Juſtice, that as <hi>England</hi> is one, our Law may be one, and that known; this will unite ſpirits and affections, whereas plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of parties or intereſts nouriſhed, they generate and conſider advantages, as hath been evident in the traverſes of this Nation.</p>
                  <p>You have ſeen the ſtanding out of the King againſt a few juſt things made at laſt, that many that would have been granted, would not ſerve the turn: I profeſs, it is meer zeal to Juſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath produced this.</p>
                  <p>I have avoided bitterneſs to the utmoſt; My only hope, deſire and prayer is for the welfare of the Nation, and the eſtabliſhing of it upon the firm <hi>baſis</hi> of moſt unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable verities; I ſhrink under the oppoſition Truth is like to find. I know the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Nations come not till Nature as it were almoſt ſtifled, labors for life, it muſt purge or periſh. I know where knowledge is greateſt, Satan is buſieſt; here muſt be great, if not the greateſt oppoſition; what God hath I hope dictated to my ſpirit, I have held forth to you of this Nation, who are in ſupream Truſt. You know how dangerous a thing it is to alter the frame of Ancient Government; you yet ſee its eaſier far to pull down then to build; to you I ſay, it muſt be extraordinary Juſtice and exemplary vertue muſt ſtabliſh you.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:105181:58"/>
                  <p>The temper of our old Engliſh Government in the mixtures of the three main Regiments was in Chriſtian Politicks heretofore held the ſoundeſt of all, moſt juſt, and ſo moſt durable: As for evil Government of Kings, through uſurpation of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the purity of it being deſtroyed, they did admit and do to this Eſtabliſhment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out King or Lords; yet if the contrary drawings of the Democratique eſtate, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiate intereſt, as old Writers have objurgated of many equals, tend to the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of preſſures, either of purſe or perſon, the iſſue will be dangerous; it's evident the looſer knots have been untied by the halter, I mean the Robber, Burgler, &amp;c. but the treble Cord of the Religious, Neceſſitous (poor which are a multitude, joyning with the pretending Leveller) and Hypocritical Oppoſer, will know their time, they look for the day of their neceſſity: There is nothing of Juſtice or Civil Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a ſtrict ſurvey more then what meer form produces, or neceſsity among the many. If there be not a ſpeedy ſettlement, there muſt be a diſ-ſettlement; the people are prone to, as well as ſtirred up to diſobedience; did you command never ſo well, if Subjects ſhake off the yoak, or looſe it but in what or as long as they pleaſe, Empire muſt down.</p>
                  <p>We are now as it were in the dregs of ſo called Populacy; the Kings attempted alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and alteration was juſt, but juſt things muſt be done juſtly; and as he ſuffered for ſeeking himſelf, ſo will others in their day (if the expected one come) mete out to you.</p>
                  <p>You are compaſſed about with difficulties every way, God give you eyes to ſee your way ſtill; we looking at your tranſactions afar off, have ſeen God going along with you; Be not deceived, you ſee it was not in eminency of Juſtice, Righteouſneſs, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Truth acted, but held forth; no, we ſaw your failings, but hope of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity; for we ſaw God evidently changing your Errors into a queſtion of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and prudence to your Enemies, ſo that they beleeved that Stratagemicall which was Caſual, or rather of providence.</p>
                  <p>O that all this might but raiſe a heart in you to ſerve and truſt God; do not only hear Sermons; and for you of other ſtations, labour Righteouſneſs in your places; your diviſions ſhew your carnality. Learn the nature of the one Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ratified to us Chriſtians ſo diſtinguiſhed from time, as of Faith and Works, that as much of Works is now requiſite under the Covenant ſo called of grace, as was before of Faith under the Covenant of works; contend not ſo much, whether Magiſtrate or Congregations be the Keeper of the firſt Table, as both to give due glory to God, and educate the people faithfully in the knowledge and practice of the Doctrine of the Goſpel; and you chief in power, to ſee to govern them according to a Rule of Righteouſneſs, upon a ſure foundation in all places and callings, which according to the Talent God hath given me, I ſhall here hold forth to you, and that out of the ſo called Law of <hi>England,</hi> or uſually accepted Law Books of the ſame with the Word of God, and the approved examples of our moſt free Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors, wherein that I name not the Authors, I have before laid down the reaſon; I ſhall only now hint, That its the duty of Magiſtrates not to regard the perſon of the man from whom the work comes; grant it but my mite, if it be pure Gold, put it into the Treaſury; I will give much light to ſome, and though others know much more, let them alſo improve their talent; make uſe of this till then.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay, 'tis the nature of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> better to follow in the dark, then go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the light; give no more occaſion to that proverb; I am no enemy to Powers or Authorities. Here is nothing difficult elevated above ordinary frame, ſo auſtere that the practice is impoſſible for a time, or dangerous to many; for it is ſalutary to ten times ſo many more; It is the reducing Government in as much as may, and the progreſſes thereof to the Rule of our Saviour, My yoak is eaſie, and my burthen light, laying forth Juſtice in a due proportion betwixt the Duty and the Power; ſo opening the reaſon of the Magiſtrates power, and the Subjects obedience, that the ancient Quarrels of Intereſts on either ſide, muſt be little, if any at all, ſtinting the many mutterings and murmurings againſt the State from the default of Officers and Clerks, not of the Judges themſelves, which if not done, do all the good you can, and you will be ſtill aſperſed and ſcandalized, and there is ſome reaſon; for they and their Clerks are alike; for their care is neither for publike good, nor common honeſty; all they look at, is private gain, the great diſhonour of a State and Nation.</p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:105181:58"/>
                  <p>Now the God of Heaven give me wiſdom to hold it forth in ſuch order that it may carry ſuch an evidence of Truth, that all Intereſts may ſubmit to this one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Regiment of Chriſtian reaſon in a Commonwealth; and what ever is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, may by your power and induſtry with the advice of ſuch whom you ſhall chooſe, be ſpeedily ſetled to his glory, and the comfort of this afflicted Nation; and ſet as a light upon a hill to be a direction and preſident to all the Nations of the Earth; That you as faithful workmen may do great things to give free liberty to the word of ſalvation, and build up the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of God, and ſet on the Gates and Barrs, Locks and Bolts, whereby the Congregations of the faithful may be kept pure within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the power of the Word, and free and ſecure from the violences of Enemies carnal and ſpiritual; and through the might of the Lord Jeſus, may ſo live here, that we may raign with him in Glory for evermore. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hoever thou art, of what ever Calling or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, know, God calls thee by his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to a ſerious conſideration of thy duty; thy duty is towards him, and thoſe to whom he hath given power over thee. They hold forth deſires of ſetling the State, and that both in Religious and Civil reſpects ſincerely. We all agree all out of order; that which naturally draws moſt men, is preſent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; this makes ſome crie out for the old Government, others one wholly new; others to ſettle their Condition, would patch and dawb, and joyn iron and clay together: I ask thus, Is the priviledge of an Engliſhman, and old Laws, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Intereſts above that of Chriſtian, Chriſts, or Gods Laws, and the inheritance of Eternity? If ſo, to them ſay ſo, I am ſilent. To the Chriſtian Engliſhman I ſay, I have propounded a Model of Chriſtian Government, I ſay not perfect, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that perfection which I do, as I conceive, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; but ſuch as may be conſtituted to fit by degrees to a more pure ſettlement. I intend not all ſhould be as here ſet down; its but an Eſſay; I have gone as neer the Original Law of England after the Nation received Chriſt, as I could; This, if accepted, muſt, as in all alterations, deſtroy many intereſts, and advantage others.</p>
                  <p>All that ſubmit in all things to the will of God, will not kick againſt him in his dealings; they will ſay, its the will of God, I ſubmit: How it ſhall be done, I leave to the great Councel of Parliament, beſeeching the Almighty to give them
<pb facs="tcp:105181:61"/> wiſdom to govern the people rightly; we are a ſtubborn Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion naturally; where grace poliſhes, look for aſſured help; where wiſdom ſettles, you will finde no reſiſtance. Go on Worthies, God is with you, and good men are not againſt you; chear their hearts; go on to ſettle; be not alwaies pulling down; its harder to build then deſtroy. I know many of you, then much more the people, will think ſome of theſe Tenets againſt priviledge; what, the Magiſtrate to ſuperadviſe private actions? be not diſquieted either to think your care will be too great, or the Subjects Liberty ſtreightned: The oppoſition is only to evil men in evil things, and that when notorious; the onely thing you all fear, is Magiſtrates may abuſe their Truſts. To all ſuch I ſay, the Law is juſt ſtill; for the man, puniſh him.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not enlarge but in one word to the Politick man; Sir, I have I confeſs not ſtuck ſo cloſe to the rules as many do, at leaſt of late; but you may ſee I offer things as I think they may be now received, to fit for better by degrees. To all I ſay, the intention of my undertaking was onely the peoples good, but eſpecially Gods glory, who knows all our hearts, and knows that I ſpeak truth, to whoſe guidance I commend your Spirits.</p>

                  <head>AN ESSAY OF Chriſtian Government.</head>
                  <div n="1" type="chapter">
                     <head>The firſt Quaere, what is Monarchy and its Diviſions?</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt, Monarchy in General, or abſolute Monarchy, is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of one man according to his own Will, without any regulation. So whether he rules juſtly, or injuſtly, hath ſeemed needleſs to quaere, ſuppoſing that the people having ſimply ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, what ever he doth is juſt, though juſt reaſon with juſt men be his Rule.</p>
                     <p>But here is to be quaeried, whether ſuch abſolute ſubjection binde the parties ſo ſubjecting themſelves to obedience in things unlawful and evidently deſtructive to publike good.</p>
                     <p>To this it is Summarily anſwered, that they themſelves are not bound; for as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth nothing in vain, ſo neither communities of men, who act together by pure Naturals, that is, look at what they call good, therefore as for preſervation of the whole, they agree to be ſubject, who were free; ſo for the ſame reaſon viſible, they may reaſſume that ſubjection into native freedom; and this the examples of all Ages, Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> manifeſt to be the Law of pure Reaſon, whether their attemps were ſucceſsful or no.</p>
                     <p>But what if bound by an Oath?</p>
                     <p>To this I ſay, the Oath muſt and can work no otherwiſe (intentionally) if free, then to the general end aforeſaid, common ſafety, and that deſtroyed, they are looſed; for the Law of Nature, and for Freedom ſake, all reaſon annexes, and muſt annex ſuch a condition to every ſuch Oath.</p>
                     <p>But what if the Oath were enforced?</p>
                     <p>I ſay, it is abſolutely and ſimply void; all Laws in all Nations in pecuniary contracts, the <hi>Minima hominis,</hi> damn enforced Oathes, then much more in main matters of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though the intereſt of Princes and great men, under colourable ſhews and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of peace, and quiet thereby, have cauſed great Wits, and great Pens to abandon Nations to the luſts of particular men.</p>
                     <p>This cleared in the abſolute Magiſtrate, it will be more then clear in the limited, that cautioned Freedom, how ever obtained, and by whom, ever muſt be obſerved; and though that the beſt ordet is a whole Repreſentative to act in enforcing and judging matters of ſo high concernment;</p>
                     <p>Yet the declarative act of breach of Truſt paſt by the major part, execution as with us may be juſt; though ſome ſay not juſtly done, (that is, in manner and form, I here admit of Form:) But ſome ſay, it had in the formal part ample ſatisfaction, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the letter of the Law, and ſo was done juſtly; for if a force were upon the houſe, it was by the houſe; and they not queſtionable, but either by the whole people, or a new Repreſentative; and this till recalled by a more lawful power, muſt be juſt; This was done by Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the place, and a ſufficient number of perſons to make a Court in Law there was; and the Law gives no power to inferiors
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105181:68"/> to take notice of the jangles of equals, eſpecially in Supremacy of Power; this in Law, in Conſcience they muſt look to themſelves, who did the Act; if unjuſt, our conſcience is to look to the preſervation of juſt liberties which we have; and in a due way to gain thoſe which under pretence of Conqueſt, paſt, or preſent, have been gained from us, and by time uſurped, which theſe men have promiſed who are our Repreſentatives, that is of the whole Kingdom; for their general and great Engagement is,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to do the Nation Right, next to ſerve the particular places faithfully for which they are choſen, and to ſee they have no wrong;</p>
                     <p>Now of theſe Monarchies; ſome are Elective, ſome Hereditary; this alters not the Cauſe, but may make men more cautions, in caſe of the Nation, whoſe Kingdom is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Hereditary ſucceſſion.</p>
                     <p>For if ſtrict Order be not held with thoſe Kings, they at laſt devolve into Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies, that is not onely (one) to Rule, but his Rule to be without any Rule not according to the Law of Righteouſneſs, but at Luſt, and then there is no way but alteration of the frame of Government in Supremacy.</p>

                     <head>4. What is Democracie, and the ends of all Government?</head>
                     <p>WHere there is equality, and the greateſt number Rule, that is called ſimple Democracie, which ever was a dangerous State, as newly drawn out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
                     <p>The next is where is the whole body thooſe never ſo vile a wretch, he is fit for the place, a Tribune of the people, and his Yea, or No goes as far as Any's.</p>
                     <p>An other Democracie is ſetled in ſeveral choices, refining the groſſer pars by degrees, and by wiſe limitations, reſtraining the way of confuſed meetings, and yet giving juſt freedoms, and to keep Juſtice pure, limiting the Electors as well as the Elected, and that not onely by reſtraints of not ſuch eſtate, or no Vagabond, or that hath been ſuch, no Thief, no out-lawed perſon, no perjured perſon, no ſervant; but ſome have Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly added, caſt out of the Church, a common Swearer, Lyer, Tavern-haunter, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaner of the Lords Day, a Gameſter.</p>
                     <p>Some now may as well ſay any one not received into a Church-fellowſhip.</p>
                     <p>This yet being the work of the Supream Magiſtrate, the more warily ordered the State is in reaſon conſtituted, the more durable.</p>
                     <p>By this it is plain, that all ſubjection was admitted for protection; and that prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction merits, and may require ſubjection, and ſubjection protection; that this power imployed againſt the end, is in Law (that is the radiance or glympſe of Divine Reaſon in man) utterly void, and all of them intend but the ſame thing, namely publike good, although they ſeek it divers wayes.</p>

                     <head>5. What form of Politie is beſt?</head>
                     <p>THis paſt, I now come to to quaere, which of theſe forms of Politie is the beſt? Wherein I cannot be of opinion, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> onely out of affection to his Pupil, raiſed Monarchy to the top of Excellency; for why ſhould he not as well have ſet his King above the Laws? but this indeed he did not, reſting in a limited Monarchy, wherein the Law was the Kings boundary; and ſurely he knew no King limited but in <hi>Greece,</hi> ſpecially in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> where I take it, he was ſubject to the Ephori, and by them to the Ax, and the Halter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I find the excellency of a Kingdom above a Commonwealth, rather by not having the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105181:68"/> Evils of Ambition and quarrels for Supremacy, then the good of Common Juſtice, Right Laws, and gallant Spirits, begotten and educated.</p>
                     <p>Tis agreed, a King is more eaſie to be corrupted, as is, and hath been ever manifeſted in all ages; and though it was then preferred as more eaſie to reduce (for few would then ſtand againſt publick intereſts) yet now it being made the Idol of vain men, and the Chriſtian world wholly o're run with vanity, it is hardeſt to be reclaimed; for things are evidenced to be eaſie or difficult, as intereſts are.</p>
                     <p>Yet Divine Providence hath here blown upon all intereſts, for they were corrupt: (Oh you that are in power, build not with ſuch hay and ſtubble ſtill, for ſurely your work is like to paſs the fire.)</p>
                     <p>But aſſuredly a Kingdom Hereditary, is far before any other Kingly Government, where the Nation is ſmall, bounds large, and ſpirits content; for Peace is moſt durable in that Government. And that will give Riches, and the people ſhall have eaſe and plenty, and grow numerous, (<hi>for emulation the mother of diſcord, is reſtrained at leaſt.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>But then the land will be too ſcant, and that Nation muſt fall upon others, or break within her ſelf, <hi>or tranſmit Colonies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Democracie</hi> muſt be in War abroad, or elſe ſhe breeds Feavers in her own bowels.</p>
                     <p>Yet <hi>Ariſtocracie</hi> and <hi>Oligarchy</hi> ſeems worſe, as partaking in more ſelfiſh intereſts; but aſſuredly in all, they are beſt or worſt, as the men Ruling are.</p>

                     <head>6. Whether the acqueſts of Kings belong to the State in Caſe of altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government?</head>
                     <p>SEeing now alterations are incident to States, it may be juſtly Quaeried, whether what is gotten by the Proweſs of a King, or Marriages, come to the Supreme pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Governing, or return back in ſuch Alterations, or the Heir Naturall to enjoy them?</p>
                     <p>The anſwer is eaſie; for all theſe things reſt in the King as King, as they were acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whether in an abſolute or limited State, they go to his Succeſſor Politick, not Natural, not in the ordinary courſe of inheritance, but according to the Tranſition of the Crown, how great Jumps ſoever it take, and this perſon dies not; ſo that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the ſupreme power hath all the acqueſts, and rights, whether Warlike, or Civil, as by Marriage, Permutations, Emptions of State, or Mortgages Real, as Cautionary Towns.</p>
                     <p>So that this Change of Government hath not diveſted <hi>England</hi> of any Title to ought due to any former Kings as Kings of <hi>England;</hi> whether in <hi>Ireland, France, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile, Cicily, Cyprus, Hieruſalem,</hi> united Provinces, or elſe where.</p>

                     <head>8. Whether better to have general, or particular Laws?</head>
                     <p>I Now muſt come to the hard task of all Polititians, That is, to ſet the <hi>Medium</hi> of power in Magiſtrates, wherein it is plain, that to tye a Magiſtrate (in any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ſupreme or inferior, yet adminiſtring Juſtice to the very ſtrict letter of the Law, is to have all the ſafety of the Commonwealth ſhipt in a Veſſel without ſails or oars; ſlip but the letter, and no Magiſtrate can meddle.</p>
                     <p>Therefore generals muſt be the way, but limited they muſt be, or elſe your venture is as much on the other ſide; for to give him no bound, or too much, is to put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a veſſel overladen, and the ſail too full, which upon every guſt is ready to ſink, or be o're turned, or run under water.</p>
                     <p>Now to paſs this <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis,</hi> is the hard work in the firſt ſettlement: That the ſupreme Magiſtrate hath his due boundary, and after for him ſo to diſpence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Magiſtrates, that the equal Temperament in every part may aſſure the ſafety of the whole.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>England,</hi> before the late fatal infuſions into King <hi>Charls</hi> his head, of the abſolute po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer due to Princes <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> whereby they were rendred accountable only to God, boaſted againſt all other Nations of the happineſs of all theſe Governments, in a ſweet and admirable admixture of power; for they had the freedom of a Commonwealth, the opulency of Ariſtocracie, the glory of a King.</p>
                     <p>Yet he ſo bounded by the Laws, and ſo watched by the Emulators of his glory, the Nobles, and by the Conſervators of our Liberties, the Commons, that it was hard for him to break.</p>
                     <p>Yet break he did, and that ſo ſuddenly, that it was evident the ſettlement we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in, was but as we ſay, <hi>A laſt gaſp to the decaying ſtate of the Baſtard</hi> William, <hi>ſo called, the Conqueror.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now is the time for them to whom God gives the Honor of a Settlement, ſo to mould and temper Government, that it may be moſt durable, which is the glory of a State.</p>
                     <p>Now to do this aright, after the Aſſurance that nothing be done, how politick or advantageous ſoever it ſeems, contrary to the light of Chriſtian Doctrine, I come to the difficulty aboveſaid, that is, <hi>What Power is to be committed to the Magiſtrate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Supreme or Inferior, reſpectively?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer generally, That the Magiſtrate, whoever he be that is intruſted, ought to have more power then its commonly requiſite he ſhould improve, that thereby by acts of Grace he may endear or ſuppreſs, as occaſion ſhall offer:</p>
                     <p>The Supreme thereby obliging all parties, as well inferior Magiſtrates, as other Subjects: the inferior Magiſtrate to engage the equals (in all but Magiſtracie) and all the vulgar, and that without puniſhment from above, or ſcorn below.</p>
                     <p>For it is evident there are ever ambitious or inſolent Spirits, who if the Magiſtrate be tyed too ſtreight, will draw him to the end of his line, and then dare him; I wiſh from my ſoul Magiſtrates were all wiſe and juſt, fearing God, and hating Covetize; but in the choyce of theſe men for intereſts, it will not be ſo; therefore I meddle not to preſcribe rules, as ſome do, for a man who prefers private intereſts, but him that onely and principally fixes himſelf, and his endeavors upon the advance of Publick and Common good; therefore to them I addreſs my ſelf, with this Caution;</p>
                     <p>That the great ruining danger, is, in times of Commotion to be over ſtrict, beyond late preſidents, and Examples; for that blows the coals of Sedition, yea ſparks to a great flame eſpecially if publick ruins build private fortunes, ſo called, or partake with any ſelfiſh intereſt.</p>
                     <p>They therefore that are in Supream truſts, and would ſettle, or continue their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments quiet, muſt themſelves in their places, and whom they impower reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, with (not onely faithfulneſs and diligence, but alſo) wiſdom and diſcreet activity, moderate that power which may be lawful, much more that which is exorbitant, or but to be uſed againſt perſons exorbitant (that is, violent Rebellious (and that in acts) diſturbers of the Peace) for againſt ſuch, to ſpare one guilty, is to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:105181:69"/> venture the deſtruction of a thouſand of innocents; <hi>In evident juſt things ſettle the power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now I come to the Rules of bounding the inferior Magiſtrate, wherein I conceive it is principally requiſite to add to the general Rules of Law, or head Laws, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Officers, by which onely it is lawful to act in time of peace, or not imminent danger.</p>
                     <p>That to this Officer being ſworn, or tyed under a ſet penalty of faithfulneſs in his Office, the Magiſtrate ſend his Warrant, expreſſing the cauſe of the Warrant, as now to Conſtables; and that this Warrant diſcharges the Officer, and then the complaint is and ought to be againſt the Magiſtrate.</p>
                     <p>For no reaſon one ſhould be puniſhed for executing his Office by command of his Superior.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it fit the Magiſtrate ſhould be too ſuddenly lyable to Queſtion; therefore it is requiſite to have ſome appointed near hand, to whom the Magiſtrate in Ordinary, and alſo the Subject may have recourſe, who knowing the Law, may ſpeedily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; for otherwiſe the Judge or Magiſtrate is diſcouraged on the one ſide to act, and the Subject on the other ſide fears his liberty to be infringed, both which muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt ſpeedily and certainly.</p>
                     <p>For it is aſſuredly meet, That every one not acting Legiſlatively, but judicially upon Laws ſet, ſhould be under the juriſdiction and Cognizance of ſome one or more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſons, and to make returns to them of at leaſt all matters doubtful.</p>
                     <p>And again, That they that act Legiſlatively ſhould not act judicially, nor be the ſame perſons, (unleſs in caſe of viſible neceſſity) leaſt otherwiſe Juſtice fail.</p>
                     <p>As for example, if the Judges of the Common Bench, Common Pleas, and Chequer were Judges in Parliament, could we think the Parliament fit to determine their Errors; lets have the beſt Laws that could be, Laws would be but dead letters ſtill in themſelves.</p>

                  <div n="9" type="chapter">
                     <head>9. Whether the Laws ought to be according to the Judicial, or what? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a head rule, or not?</head>
                     <p>I Come now to that great and old (difference, or) difficulty, what is the boundary to humane Power, or Authority, or Dominion, call it what you will, it is the executive vertue in the Magiſtrate Supream, in dictating, or giving forth of Laws.</p>
                     <p>Now I in this ſhall wave treating of Law, in its variety of objects, and ſhortly give you this deſcription of it.</p>
                     <p>It is the Rule of well ordering Societies of men, or many Families of men living to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and aims eſpecially at preſerving the poor and weak, againſt the rich and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it is truth, that many Nations have divers Laws, yea, great variety, and all juſt; and ſome Nations have a few Laws, and many unjuſt; naturally, each one ſeeks particular good.</p>
                     <p>But as this grew obnoxious to particular perſons or families, they joyned together, and that under agreements, wherein there being ſtill particular reſpects according to the advantages and diſadvantages of the Covenanters, ſo were the Laws more or leſs unjuſt; but ofttimes that which was ſeen unjuſt after, was not diſcovered ſuch at the time of enacting.</p>
                     <p>Hence ſome have, to take away all wrangles, fallen upon a Community; ſome from Community, to Property, ſtill looking to avoid the preſent evil; yea from hence indeed ſpring all the Commotions, and hurries of the world, which ſo Rent and ſhake people and Nations.</p>
                     <p>So that there was nothing ſo highly honored, as the enacting good Laws; I take it to be the Original, at leaſt one of the chief Originals of the <hi>Heroes,</hi> or <hi>Daemones,</hi> men Deified (ſo God himſelf ſtiles Magiſtrates, becauſe of their Repreſentation of him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men) and all theſe Law-givers pretended at leaſt to receive them from the gods, or the friends of the gods.</p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:105181:70"/>
                     <p>For even to natural men it ſeemed juſt, that what wiſe men had inſtit uted, wiſe men might alter.</p>
                     <p>Now if theſe Laws were onely ſome Prerogatives of the Princes, or Priviledges of great men, which men had ſought to uſher into the world with ſuch pomp, there might have been a ground for obſtruction; but theſe which were the Laws of well living, the Laws tending to publick quiet, repoſe, riches, &amp; honor, (cuſtom of living being equal to, if not above nature) were of neceſſity thus brought in, onely by fear of the ſuppoſed Gods; yea, alſo the future Magiſtrate was by this (ſuperſtition, call it ſo) onely kept in aw, not to break forth into exorbitant affections, or decline action, either not to make the Law like the knife of <hi>Delphos</hi> for all purpoſes, or elſe for no purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>So are men byaſſed by private reſpects on the one hand, and loving ſupremacy of power on the other, that unleſs there be ſome over-awing decree, ſome ſetled boundary, beyond which we muſt not paſs, there is no ſafety.</p>
                     <p>Now if it be ſaid, this is indeed true in the cauſe of natural men, but not ſo to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; Grace perfects nature: I agree, it is truth in ſome ſence, but not in every part; for it is rather true in the future, then any other Tenſe; for it works here in the fleſh not ſo intenſively, but more remiſly, yea, ſometimes the effectual work of grace ſeems dead; that this is true, the agreed failings of the Saints evidence.</p>
                     <p>Yea thoſe in whom the work of Grace was begun ſure enough; as witneſs <hi>Davids</hi> Pride, Murther, Adultery, <hi>&amp;c. Samuels</hi> ſufferance of his ſons, <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and all others before Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter,</hi> the ſons of <hi>Zebedee, Paul, Barnabas</hi> and others, under the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>So that it is plain we muſt remember it to be truth in ſome ſort, which was objected againſt <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> councelling <hi>Alexander,</hi> (as was pretended) to uſe the Greeks as friends, and carry himſelf as their Guide and Conductor; but to uſe the <hi>Barbarians</hi> (meaning thereby all other Nations) as enemies, and carry himſelf towards them as Lord and Maſter.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of their objection was very acute; for ſay they, there are many Greeks wicked, and many vertuous <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that if any <hi>Quaere,</hi> whether Laws ſhould be diverſe in reſpect of divers ſorts of men, it is ſhortly anſwered, Laws are to reſtrain and puniſh onely evil, whether men or actions.</p>
                     <p>This being cleared, the next thing is to come to the more cloſe and plain reſolving of the queſtion, wherein I cannot urge antiquity; for I wave all Authors more then as illuſtrative, taking none as Authoritative; the ſuperintendency of the Expurgatorian Claſſis abroad in forreign Authors, and our <hi>Licentia,</hi> or <hi>Placet</hi> at home, making them ſpeak what they liſt, or as they liſt who are maſters of the Preſs; for if ſo done to ſome, why not to all? or who can tel to which? and indeed there is no neceſſity of either anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or modern teſtimony, the Almighty wiſdom having the ſame fountain of endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, graces and abilities as in any age, and the ſame as plentifully poured out now upon us, however it is improved.</p>
                     <p>This premiſed, I then <hi>Quaere,</hi> what law is exiſtent among any or all the Nations of the world, like that which is called <hi>Moſes Judicial,</hi> holding forth ſuch fit and apt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, as are there laid down, carrying with it ſuch a viſible reaſon for it ſelf, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Rule of Proportion?</p>
                     <p>I may ſay that the law of <hi>England</hi> did own this as its neceſſary pattern (it is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom denyed) but if any do oppoſe, or doubt, let them firſt conſider, That no law in <hi>England</hi> was ſetled (generally at leaſt) until the Pope had come to an obliging power, and that agreed; ſure as he aped the Ceremonials, he did engage a conformity in Princes as far as might be to the Judicials.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now ſee the onely or main objections againſt the Judicials, which may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, I take it, to three chiefly.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, they were given to the Jew.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are not, or cannot all be performed by us; for ſome were onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Jew, ſome no way fitting this Nation, for they were never received; and there is a neceſſity of altering laws as vices encreaſe, and grow more Obnoxious; and alſo in regard the Judicials themſelves are not all ſo clear that it can be ſaid which are all the Judicials, by reaſon of mixtures of Ceremonials with them.</p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:105181:70"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Law of Chriſt is a Law of Love, not Revenge, to pray for enemies, do good to them that hate us, turn the other cheek to him ſtrikes one, and give the cloke to him takes the coat, and go two miles with him enforces thee to one.</p>
                     <p>God aſſiſting, we will endeavor to clear theſe Heads; and then in conſideration of the particular Laws, anſwer ſome particular Objections, if any be ſeen needful.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the firſt, That theſe things were immediatly directed by the Almighty wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the <hi>Jew,</hi> it is agreed; But what doth this hold forth? Sure onely this, That the <hi>Jew</hi> was bound by them, God having commanded them to that Nation, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not obedience from the other Nations to whom he had given no command, but that any other Nation might not uſe them, it proves not;</p>
                     <p>But rather that thoſe Laws, as far as holding forth a rule of Juſtice to them which had no Rule, or a better, where defective, ought by theſe Nations to whom they were known, to be eſtabliſhed, is ſure out of controverſie, while Legiſlators have Juſt and Good for their Rule. To the ſecond, That they cannot be all performed by us, Let us ſee the hindrances.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Some being ſuppoſed onely proper to the <hi>Jew,</hi> if we come to ſearch what thoſe be which we cannot perform, there appear here viſibly but the Law concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Trials of Adultery, and Virginity; we allow theſe ought to be inquired into, and ſatisfaction given to the jealous ſpirit; but we preſume the ſpecial Law binds not; That in caſe of Virginity, being, though natural, yet as it were onely proper to that Nation, and that by ſome extraordinary power of Divinity, giving forth Teſtimony to his own Law.</p>
                     <p>The other ſimply extraordinary, in regard the ſame water wrought ſo contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; ſo that the vertue was evidently not in the water: and if we ſhould ſearch the depth, the ſeeds, though conceived by of the Adulterer, could work no more then of a husband in the ordinary courſe of Nature.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo ſome particular Laws of two wives, humbling of Handmaides, with ſome others.</p>
                     <p>The next ſort of Laws are ſuch as are ſaid hold no proportion with the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the people of this or other Chriſtian Nations; and therefore the Nations ſetled others, and never received them.</p>
                     <p>To this part I anſwer; That if it never received them, there was no trial, whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Nation or not. Next if tried, how doth this indiſpoſition in Nations generally to the receit of particular Laws appear? ſure it is not by way of Antipathy, ſo that the Nation fails, dies, or is removed upon receiving of them; truth is, we all agree, Nations may be altered by Laws, as the <hi>Romanes</hi> brought from natural ſavageneſs to a more moderate temper by <hi>Numa's</hi> Laws; and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> by thoſe of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus;</hi> and they may be heightned and debaſed in ſpirit, as well as moderated; but all this reſts not in the Law, but the executive part or power of it.</p>
                     <p>Now that force will naturalize Laws, it is plain; why then not Reaſon? It is evident, Laws are the reins of Reaſon over the beaſtial part of man; therefore now to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man any juſt Law is approveable; as to his obedience, he is a Law to himſelf, and happily gives far leſs liberty to his particular beaſt, his appetite, be it to, or in what it will, then it is fit the general Law ſhould hold forth; and this hath juſt wiſdom in it; hereby are the good and wiſe diſtinguiſhed from the vain and idle, even by the ſubjection of natural appetite: from whence it is hereby clear, that to govern a fierce Nation, the ſame Laws will not ſerve, as to govern a quiet peaceable one.</p>
                     <p>But now our Quaere muſt be, whether there be not be a juſt Law in the generality, agreeable to the light of Nature, ſet down in the Judicial heads of Law, which will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to govern all Nations by; take two Laws for example, Murder and Theft.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is the head-Law of mankinde towards his like, the prime end of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy being to preſerve life.</p>
                     <p>The next is goods; Now in this I finde no looſe to the Magiſtrate, but life muſt be for life; if murder, that is, lieing in waite, or as with us malice before hand; in this the Magiſtrate hath no liberty to ingratiate in refined Reaſon; it lies upon the Land, if not expiated with the blood of the offender, and ſo upon the City, and ſo upon the Army.</p>
                     <p>But the chief guilt ſurely lies upon the chief Magiſtrate, who is the prime in truſt executive as to the fact; this ſure is, and ought to be death in all Nations.</p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:105181:71"/>
                     <p>The like head-Rule of common Juſtice is in the Law of the manſlaier at unawares; and ſurely of this ſort there will be no doubt, nor of the expiation of incertain mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which ought to be ſetled rightly by an Oath of Inquiſition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the great quaere will be concerning Theft, which is the matter moſt, or with the moſt to be conſidered, as a grould of controverſie.</p>
                     <p>For the moſt of Chriſtian Nations have made it death, yet the Judicial maketh it death in no kinde, That puniſhing life with life, and goods with goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the rule of proportionate Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Now this alteration is not without reaſon as things ſtand, that is, upon the received principles forementioned out of the ſeeming contrariety which Chriſtians have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the Law Judicial, and Apoſtolical.</p>
                     <p>For they have gathered, that Chriſts Kingdom being of brothers, there ſhould be no ſervants; that is, no ſlaviſh ſervitude, or bondmen, which was the iſſue of not ſatisfying what was ſtollen with the <hi>Jew;</hi> and upon this preſumption, they at laſt wholly abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, as to Theft, the mulcts of two, three, four, or ſeven-fold reſtored for his life, and took away his life; now this being onely practice, cannot determine the Controverſie.</p>
                     <p>Let us then ſee the Reaſons if any be, whereof the moſt eminent is that of Magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Intereſt, whereby he would wave a limitation, or rule in ordinary, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf abſolute in every condition.</p>
                     <p>For Supremacy generally aims at abſolute Power in all eſtates, Royal, or Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or mixt, though they maintain their intereſt diverſly, according to evident princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, upon which their foundation ſtands; this therefore is a Politick rule; but how warranted by Supremacy of Reaſon, upon the pure principle of common or univerſal good, or what Rule in the Word, muſt be examined; in the written Word there is owned nothing as clear; for ſure then the controverſie with ſome one good Magiſtrate, or Commomwealth or other would be determined, and the intereſt of Righteouſneſs would cloud the intereſts of riches, honor, power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This therefore failing, let us ſee the Reaſon; the firſt part whereof is in neceſſity of altering Laws, according to emergencies; to which it is anſwered, That Laws in inflicting juſt penalties may be higher or lower according to emergency; and the rigorous, or exact execution may be juſtly inforced; but the incompatibility or diſproportion of the Law of Death for Theft is, in that all the goods of a Prince are not of equal worth as goods, be they Horſes, Kine, Gold; Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the head of a Slave, conſider him as man: nay, the Lord touches not mans liberty for goods meerly, if he had wherewith to reſtore; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Reaſon will not avail.</p>
                     <p>But if we conſider the Quaere a little further, there will appear leſs reaſon yet; and that is, that even Chriſtians themſelves doubt not, but that would the Magiſtrate wave his advantages, both to himſelf, Clerks, Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the death of Felons, and ſtrictly ſee to the Execution but of reſtoring two or three fold, Theft would not be the one hundred part ſo frequent as now it is; for though generally it be truth, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of life is the prime principle of Nature, and he will part with all to ſave that:</p>
                     <p>Yet the ſpirits of ſome men are ſuch, being not poliſhed by divine precept, that they ſcorn to live but as they have been educated; ſome will dye rather then labour, and ſo Thieve, or commit any villany.</p>
                     <p>Now it is by ſome thought theſe may be put to death, but theſe do not put theſe men to death for Theft, but not having to reſtore, they impriſon them to ſatisfie by labor, their wrongs; and if they break priſon they dye for it; ſo that death is now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon them, not only by the equity of the Law Judicial, but univerſal reaſon cutting off this diſobedient ſon, rooting out this Moth of the Commonwealth; and there is ſure much of Juſtice in this; for now with Chriſtians to proſecute a Felon (as any other criminous perſon) will coſt a man in expence of time, and Fees, and other charges, as much as would have kept his Family a moneth, which added to his loſs who would proſecute, yet compound the Law forbids, but I intend haſte.</p>
                     <p>The next reaſon is, the Judicials are ſo mixed with Ceremonials:</p>
                     <p>To which it is anſwered, that many are clear, uſe them; the other ſearch out how the mixture ſtands; for if there be a plain Law of diſtributive Juſtice, a neceſſary rule for the benefit of Societies, take that; and if there be no corrupt intereſt in it, ſure it will be accepted by wiſe men, though meer Politicians may baulk it, as well as enact it, as King <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. did in caſe of Marriages.</p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:105181:71"/>
                     <p>I am now come to the great head of all, namely that the Judicials were a Law of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, which now is proper to God, Chriſtians muſt not fight, war, revenge, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>I could with ſome ſay I admire the wonderfull goodneſs, mercy, long-ſufferance, patience, &amp;c. of God, who willing to ſhew the Riches of his mercy, forbears the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of wrath fitted for deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Art thou a Chriſtian that objecteſt againſt the Judicials to elate another Magiſterial power then that of the Regiment of the Lord Chriſt? for though they were given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> they were the Dictates of the prime verity: And where O man haſt thou ſuch a pattern!</p>
                     <p>But thou wilt ſay, We are Chriſtians, and we have no need of Laws?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer with <hi>Paul,</hi> If thou beeſt the Law to thy ſelf, the Law puniſhes thee not; Rulers are ſet up for the puniſhment of evil doers: So ſaid the Lord to <hi>Cain</hi> in the firſt two thouſand years; And ſo ſaith the Spirit to the world in the laſt two thouſand.</p>
                     <p>But ſay you, we acknowledge a Law to men, but not Chriſtians; Brethren, be not deceived; remember what <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, The unlearned and unſtable wreſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to their own deſtruction; the place I pitch upon to clear up the Righteouſneſs of the Law even to Chriſtians, is that of the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. from the 8. to 14. There are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of places hinting the ſame, I at preſent know none more pregnant; for thence it is plain, that there were then many controverſies ſtirred by the Chriſtian Iews, or ſo pretending, concerning the obſervance of the whole Moſaical Law, whether Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial or Judicial.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> had beaten down as much as in him lay, the Ceremonial, ſhewing it was but the ſhadow, the body was Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning the Judicials particularly there is no queſtion, but from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſes, and from other places it is plain what was intended; for in the 9. verſe, he ſheweth wherefore the Law was made.</p>
                     <p>Firſt Negatively, not for the Righteous, (the foundation of great errors while miſapplied.)</p>
                     <p>Next Affirmatively, for the lawleſs and diſobedient, ungodly and ſinners, unholy and prophane; theſe are general.</p>
                     <p>Now he comes to particulars, Murderers, Manſlayers, Whoremongers, Buggerers, Men-ſtealers, Lyers, Perjured perſons, and againſt all other things contrary to ſound Doctrine, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>There is an objection againſt this, <hi>viz.</hi> theſe things are Morall.</p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer, that if you take Morall for the Law of the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they are not literally there; if you intend Moral for what ever is contained virtually under theſe heads, the two generals whereof comprehend the whole duty of man to God, and to his brother, all mankind, then the whole Judicial at leaſt muſt be therein comprized.</p>
                     <p>If you intend by Moral, what the light of perfect reaſon holds forth concerning juſt and good, no man dare ſay the Judicials wanted the height of perfect Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>If you look at it as rectified by Evangelical Doctrine, then it is anſwered, that the primitive error is the cauſe of our now wandering.</p>
                     <p>Firſt generally ſeeing the errors which have flowed by the Church to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, we confuſedly judge this to riſe from the principle of the Judicials, and lay all the pride, covetize, and various intereſts of Princes Courts, Judges Fees, and unjuſt and unneceſſary dependancies, Nurſes of Heatheniſh and deteſtable wickedneſs, villany and enſnaring dependencies to life and liberty of common Societies as well as particular men upon the Judicial.</p>
                     <p>Next it is beleeved, that Chriſtians take the Judicials proper to them, as to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totype of the Jew, which might be; but now a clearer light manifeſts higher things, or is ſo pretended to.</p>
                     <p>The main particular and worthy conſideration is our formation of Chriſtian policy according to the Jewiſh Model; for we held all Baptized as Circumciſed to be Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Now of theſe, how excellent Chriſtians we have, the Gallows, Gaoles, Houſes of Correction for puniſhment, and all places of vanity, ſuch as almoſt the Heathen would
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105181:72"/> bluſh at, Drinking, Dicing, Drabbing, &amp;c. publickly known, manifeſtly proclaim; and though no rents to the State, as at <hi>Rome,</hi> for the Stews; yet to the Stateſmen they enhance Farm Rents, &amp;c. for ſurely, were there no advantageous intereſts, they would not againſt common profeſſion be upon ſo weak reaſons as they are, tolerated, while winked at; yet what is done with theſe Chriſtians? lo they are puniſhed, are they not? Surely no, not one of ten, if one of a hundred; and this puniſhment is the ſacrificeing for ſin; and this paſt, they are if it be but commutation, as clear Chriſtians as the beſt; and being now become more ſerviceable to corrupt intereſts, theſe ſpied out the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Liberties of better Chriſtians, which the Judicials not affording a whip for,</p>
                     <p>The Magiſtrate muſt be looſed from his reſtraint rather then not have an honeſt man puniſhed; this raiſed error upon error, and opened this looſe to the Chriſtian to ſeek freedom from an unjuſt Law; and to the Magiſtrate, to ſeek to puniſh at luſt: But if you ſee through all the Apoſtles Writings, they only forbid the ſin; and for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, look at the Law in general, which ſurely they could not intend but of the Judicial.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Commands of Chriſt the Lord, and the Precepts of Love, Charity, Patience, forbearance, &amp;c. they are certainly true, and to be obſerved; and then the Quaere or Objection is, what need of Law? The Anſwer to this is as evident as the other, That the pureſt Congregations, Churches, &amp;c. have had, and ever will have evil men among them, not only hypocrites but open ſinners; The error of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not ejecting, or Magiſtrates not puniſhing, or not due regulating by puniſhment, rather ſhews the neceſſity of Law, then the uſeleſneſs of it.</p>
                     <p>Now grant that the whole Nation were purely Church-Members, of which no viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cauſe of ejecting or rejecting communion appeared; yet there would or might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe many debates, differences and controverſies, which would require a Magiſteriall Authority to determine, if but for difficulty; And ſurely the Congregations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians never ſo little declining, could not avoid litigations and wranglings; and there being no word to extirpate the Civil Magiſtracie, it becomes not Chriſtians to wrangle, much leſs violently to oppoſe ſo approved, ſo neceſſary an Ordance; That opinion that in the ſimplicity of the laſt Age, as in the beginning, the father of the Family ſhall be King and Prieſt, hath little warrant; that hath more, that each Saint ſhall be ſo; and yet in the mean time, as hitherto, ſubject to the powers; yea, the Heathen ones, for conſcience ſake, of the radiancy or glimpſe of the Divinity holden forth in them.</p>
                     <p>It is truth, pure Chriſtians will not be contentious, ſome meek ſpirits may and will obey the letter of Chriſt; and ſure they that do ſo in faith, ſhall not fare the worſe for their exact obedience; but in the mean-time, this is no binding rule to us, except the words be ſo intended.</p>
                     <p>It is truth, the child of God ſeeks not his own, &amp;c. he is wholly taken up with God, &amp;c. ſhall the Magiſtrate therefore ſee evil againſt him go unpuniſhed? Again, love and not avengeing wrongs, and praying for enemies in the ſpiritual ſence, may ſtand with the puniſhing, afflicting, and bringing to judgement the body of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor in the literal; yea, God is thereby glorified; otherwiſe how can the peace of good men be preſerved againſt the wicked, but miraculouſly? which we have no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to expect at preſent, and what ſhall be hereafter, as the light manifeſts it ſelf, the Lord grant we may walk in it, and alſo up to it; and that our Laws may be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed according to a rule of Righteouſneſs, even according to the wiſdom revealed by God himſelf; and that all emergent Laws may flow from the ſame fountain; for for every action contingent there is as is agreed no particular Law already ſetled, nor well can be, but the Chriſtian Magiſtrate ought to provide that not the leaſt wrong or treſpaſs but be righted or puniſhed.</p>
                     <p>I muſt yet remove one rub, and that is, the Judicials have been our miſguider hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, therefore better any other Law then them; 'tis the ſame that was objected for uſing of formes, whether of prayer or otherwiſe which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> uſed (and was partly ſpoken to before particularly) in that all our old errors having ſprung from that root that it is neceſſary, yea, ſome ſay of neceſſity, to wave that for our rule leſt we tread the ſame trace of error, that was before our ruine; and therefore better take our Laws from Turk or Perſian, or &amp;c. then from the Judicials.</p>
                     <p>Now let us examine this, and all will appear vain; for firſt it is denyed, that the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105181:72"/> obſerving the Judicials, yea though as binding as the prototype, was the error of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ſo as to bring ſo horrible a defection upon our Judicatories.</p>
                     <p>We maintain not (I deſire to be rightly underſtood) That this Nation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſtianity, is bound to the <hi>Moſaicall Judicials</hi> in the command to the <hi>Jew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But aſſay to manifeſt that thoſe Judicials were not our miſguidance. The Decalogue or Ten Commandements we all agree (except in the ſet day of the Sabboth) to hold forth but even what Natures light determinately approves, whereby it is evident that ſin is the ſame to us as with them, which all the writings of the Apoſtles manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>Now the ſin in the head Law being the ſame, what difference in the branches, either in reſpect of the ſeverall <hi>ſpecies</hi> of tranſgreſſion, or manners of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Now as to theſe we all agree the error an error, but we muſt differ concerning the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nfliction of puniſhment, which I drive to this head;</p>
                     <p>That the Law preſcribed in the Judicial for puniſhment, holds a due proportion, puniſhing life with life, goods with goods, &amp;c. if ſo, then that theſe mediums or rules of due puniſhment ought much more to be obſerved by the Chriſtian Magiſtrate under the Law of the Goſpel, the glad tydings of peace and mercy, then by the Jew, and not to outbound, unleſs after the utmoſt of execution the Law be found evidently defective, which I preſume it never will be under prudent Magiſtrates.</p>
                     <p>Now to him that ſayes the obſervation of theſe Laws was our ground of error;</p>
                     <p>I ſay in the Ceremonials of <hi>Moſes</hi> it was; and that the receiving of the Judicials might open a gap to introduce that error the more facily, I will not deny; but that this muſt either caſt out the Judicial, or make us take the Rule (for this in any juſt Law I preſume muſt be) from the hand of a Heathen rather then from the word of promiſe, is the fruit of ſtrong contemplative zeal; for the puniſhment, ſo it holds its due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, take it from the Turk if you will, or Perſian, it matters not.</p>
                     <p>The Turks puniſhment, ſo it be not Torture, may ſuit beſt the ſpirit or <hi>genius</hi> of the Nation; for to burn, hang, behead, or ſtone, all is but death; and this difference, had Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies ſo called been lawfull to be enjoyned, might have ſtinted our controverſie of old between the then ſo called Proteſtants and Puritans for the receiving the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, ſet formes of Prayers, Ornaments and Formes of and in Church-Service ſo called.</p>
                     <p>And aſſuredly it ever hath been one of the Devils gyns, to fright men from truth and right by miſcarriages in the manner, &amp;c. hence cometh the ſcandals of profeſſion from the errors, if but of one or two hypocritical or miſ-led profeſſos; we may as well refuſe the Scriptures becauſe Heretiques uſe them; and that they lead to <hi>Judaiſme</hi> is a great error; for ſurely <hi>Judaiſing</hi> was intimated in no part of the Judicial Law, of which any queſtion can be.</p>
                     <p>For the exception in Fornication, things ſtrangled, and blood, the laſt two being meats, we are now freed from.</p>
                     <p>There is a holy jealouſie which is for God, and is commendable; and there is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy from intereſt, which is Idolatrous and wicked; the Lord open mens eyes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe in Authority, rightly to diſtinguiſh that they be not found fighters againſt God.</p>
                     <p>Now who are to expound this Law, and ſettle it, and how far their power extends, is our next task.</p>

                     <p>For what have we to do with Law-makers, of or among men, when God himſelf hath fitted the work to our hand?</p>
                     <p>But theſe men muſt know, that time brings to light new inventions of ſin, Satan goes about in variety of ſhapes and deceives daily, and theſe offences many of them will be difficultly referred to the proper head of Tranſgreſſion; therefore it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that there be a ſuperintendency to oreview theſe errors and apply a remedy in time according to their rule, yet to puniſh life with life, goods with goods, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe are various according to the either condition or conſtitution of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or both; the conſtitution according to ſetled Law and conſtantly received; the condition time of war or peace.</p>
                     <p>Now the time of war being only accidental, we are ſpecially to conſider acts done according to the ſetled conſtitution of the Nation, be it by Monarchy abſolute, or limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or Republique; Republiques of all or any ſort; and their boundary is common and publique good, and that either according to emergent neceſſity, as in caſe the elders of <hi>Gibeah</hi> had conſented to have all their eyes put out for National advantage; for in ſuch a caſe the elders had turned evident Traytors to their truſts, but to loſe one or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eye.

                     <head>11. What are the proper Rights of the ſupream Magiſtrate, ſo called, Prerogative.</head>
                     <p>NOw in the handling of this Queſtion it is fit a little to open what is Prerogative; now this ſimply taken, is the Priviledge or preheminence that one party hath, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther above, or before another, and ſo is no more then to have that of right and duty, which others have by accident or by favor, as to have the moſt honourable place, to be heard firſt, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>But to take it in the proper latitude, it is the ſum of all thoſe powers, priviledges, Rights and Immunities neceſſary to the Supream Power, whether perſon or perſons (according to the ſtrict rule) that thereby the people may be the better governed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the looſe rule, that the people may be kept in ſubjection, and the glory of the King or Ruler exalted, and that as to abſolute Power over both body and goods.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore to treat of Prerogative in ſuch a ſence, is vain; for Prerogative is abſolute power; and what the Prince pleaſeth is his Prerogative, and this was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly aymed at here.</p>
                     <p>Now Prerogative, according to the ſtrict Rule, is of two ſorts, that is, more, or leſs ſtrict; as for example, ſome Prerogatives primarily uſurped, by time are agreed to, and after conſtituted, ſuch as our vaſſalage of Tenures, whether in <hi>Capite,</hi> or that by grand or petite <hi>Serj. Eſcuage, Knights Service, Soccage,</hi> or <hi>Villenage;</hi> all which the eſtates of the Nation have looked upon, and not annulled, but regulated, and the Kings ſought to avoid thoſe Regulations.</p>
                     <p>Now the more ſtrict Rule of Prerogative, is, to give the dues neceſſary, and that both for honour, and order, and ſafety, which both the other are but as handmaids to; for the etymologicall fautaries, I paſs them, intending to hold out truth in her native ſimplicity, without the ammuſive garniſh of needleſs witty vanities.</p>
                     <p>This then agreed, what Prerogative is in general, from hence it may be collected, that what ever is neceſſary, or rather of neceſſity, to the well being of the whole, is to be in the Supream Power: Now this which is by ſome, and generally alledged as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Kings, yet muſt be alſo in all Supream Magiſtrates, as Dukes, Earls, &amp;c. yea though Vaſſals or Tributaries to other Princes, and muſt be alſo in Republiques, or where the ſupremacy of power reſts in more then one perſon, whether <hi>Ariſtocratical, Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gichal,</hi> or the pure Republique, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Democratique</hi> State.</p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:105181:73"/>
                     <p>For the Prerogative is incident naturally to the Supremacy of power, and that of neceſſity; for they are the Superintendents of the whole body, and are to have requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites to that Office, as neceſſarily as the father of a Family or any inferiour Magiſtrate under him ought to have, to govern in their bounds, precincts, limits and places; and therefore the Law of <hi>England</hi> juſtly in the matter (however in the attribute, or that to admit compariſon with the Almighty, might or may offend ſome mens eares) by way of illuſtrative Analogy, gave a kind of ubiquity or omnipreſence to the King, and ſo to the ſupream Magiſtrate, as the firſt part of his Prerogative, his diffuſed power (for common good ſo ordered) manifeſting it ſelf in all Offices whereby the publick peace (ſo called the Kings peace) was preſerved, and was neceſſary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where.</p>
                     <p>But as more neceſſary, ſo more apparent in the Courts of Juſtice, all of which were called the Kings Courts, and the Proceſs the Kings, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now we being ruled by Laws; for to avoid the inconveniencies afore-mentioned of puſillage and folly, and alterations accidental to the beſt of men depraved, through the fall, make this ſupream power vertually to reſt in ſetled Laws, and by them they rule, and ſo neither death, folly, nor any kind of wrong, or injury, can by the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Law be done or ſuffered by the ſupremacy of power, ſo that truly the Law ſaith, the King can do no wrong, that is, the Law by the ſupremacy of power, enables him not to do wrong; and to ſpeak out the whole truth, to men of the meaneſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; This law, and the right underſtanding and executing of it, is the higheſt Prerogative of any of Gods Vicegerents, in higher or lower ſphears, and is the agreed Rule of common good, as before-ſaid.</p>
                     <p>Now our great error and deluſion of late was to give that to the perſon, which was due to the Office, and to ſubjugate the Office to the perſon, and not the perſon to the Office, which the Law would never admit; for the Law, that is the purity, yea, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendencie of Reaſon, leaves the perſon of the Prince naked, in caſe of Male Action, though it cenſures not in all male adminiſtration, where it admits him poſitively to judge.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall give you an example to illuſtrate; for if the King enters a mans houſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, and offers to vitiate his wife, daughter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and be ſlain of the father, husband, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is but as the death of an ordinary perſon; and truly by the principles of the ſetled Law be he known, it is no more.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall put but one Example more; A Traytor is by vertue of the Kings Writ, brought before the Judge, Arraigned, and Condemned; the King grants no pardon, (which I ſuppoſe he in ſuch Caſes cannot generally, though it was done cuſtomarily) nor uſes no legal peaceably way, but by force perſonal ſets himſelf in Act by his Guard to take this Traytor out of the hands of that Juſtice to which in his Politick capacity he hath Sentenced him; and the Sheriffs men defending the Law; and the Guard by the perſonal command of the King, ſeeking the overthrow of it, by taking away ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally the priſoner; and they fighting about it, and the King running in, he is ſlain, it is no murder by the principles of the Law, which owns not the King in this Act of Tort and Force, and takes no notice of the death of that perſon as King, who in Law dies not; for the Law cannot now take notice of it, becauſe out of his Sphear; by this it is evident to what end the Magiſtrate is cloathed with ſo called Prerogative, namely the advance of publike intereſt.</p>
                     <p>Now, as in this ſort, it gives to the ſupream Magiſtrate the glory of the Courts of Juſtice, and the diſpoſings of them, as one part of Prerogative; ſo knowing the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Supream Power cannot be maintained but by ſome ſet way, as it ſeems the Ancients provided here, ſo much of all ſorts of proviſion, both for the Kings Family, as alſo for his Stable, at the ſo called Kings price exceedingly abuſed, beſides the ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſetled revenues of the Crown, namely Crown lands, Fee-Farm Rents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So it alſo provided for Emergencies, and that both for charges upon the ſea, and alſo for the land by Cuſtoms now ſo called, Fines, Forfeitures, (wrecks of the ſea how unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever) land deſerted of the ſea, lands of Ideots, Treaſure found, goods without owners, Tythes of lands out of Pariſhes, and the like: And upon theſe, or any other matter, if any debt did accrue, it was ſatisfied to the King, (that the Commonwealth might not loſe) before any private perſon could be ſatisfied one penny, (the abuſe of this was grown intolerable, but I here treat of Settlements) and how long ſince it was
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105181:74"/> in the Kings caſe it matters not; for no ſlipping of time could prejudice the Kings Title, as in caſe of a common perſon, who was tied to ſue within ſuch a time, or the time might be pleaded in Bar as was juſtly enacted.</p>
                     <p>Now the reaſon of this was juſt and good, preferring publike and univerſal good before private and particular; yet this proved offenſive oft-times, becauſe it was made the inſtrument to abſolute Injuſtice, while reſtitution was made to the King, to the evident deſtruction of a ſtranger, that is a third perſon whom the Law left remedileſs, yea though utterly undone, and begging from door to door.</p>
                     <p>It was alſo for the ſame reaſon conſtrued to be Law, that in all Grants made by the King, they ſhould be taken moſt beneficially for him; and that they ſhould not erre to any other conſtruction then what was manifeſted in the body of the Grant, that is, the plain letter muſt be taken, and no implicite conſtruction of Law ſhall be taken advantage of, againſt the good of the Commonwealth, as againſt a particular party.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, In caſe of Grants it is void, if it appears that the King was deceived in his Grant; truth, theſe originally juſt things, after the fatall wiſdom of the Law was politickly perfected, came to be made the Myſtery of Iniquity; for it was ſaid, the Grants were made according to theſe received Rules for the Kings ſole benefit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he that was once made the Kings Officer, was ever after ſcandalized for a Knave; and he that was once the Kings Farmor, Grantee, or Debitor, his eſtate was alwayes after eſteemed incombred.</p>
                     <p>Now this was more feared when it was granted to him by Judgement of the Judges, that he in Temporals might by a Clauſe of <hi>Non obſtante,</hi> diſpence with any Statute Law; and that though the Statute ſaith ſuch diſpenſations ſhould be utterly void, as it was in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh; the beginning was in <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, not ſo plain; Acts of Parliament bind not the King unleſs eſpecially named.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe unhinged all our Liberties; for by the one he was not bound except na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and by the ſecond he might diſpence how-ever named; therefore theſe, how ever uſed, I cannot reckon as legal Prerogative.</p>
                     <p>I now proceed with Prerogative called Juſt; that is, That the King, or Supream Power for the benefit of the Commonwealth, have the eſtates of thoſe that die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heir; for no private or particular heir being, the publike is rightly preferred; ſo if they purchaſe who have no right, as Aliens; they have alſo given him thoſe Royal Mines of gold and ſilver, leſt ſuch things in Subjects ſhould raiſe them ſo high, as they ſhould be able by leavying Arms, to conteſt for the Supremacy, and attempt a Tyranny.</p>
                     <p>Now this, if agreed, as agreed, is moſt juſt; They gave him ſome honorary reſpects meerly; as for example; That the Lord ſhould not ſeiſe his Villein in his preſence; how juſtly, may well be Quaeried.</p>
                     <p>For if juſt to be done, why not more juſt before him? To which may be added, That Amerciaments, Fines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which had no exact literal Rule, as offences made by Statute puniſhable by the Juſtices at Seſſions with unlimited Fine or Amerciaments, were ſaid to be by vertue of his Prerogative as his Iuſtices, that is, they were to Fine at diſcretion, that is, according to the nature of the fact, reſpect had to the Law; that is, ſaving his Freehold, or not to the value of his Freehold; or ſo that he ſhould not for to pay that Fine be put to ſell his Freehold; all which are argued for, with much nicety, little Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p>Now as for the benefit of the Commonwealth the Law put the King into poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others (though by matter of Record) ſo it kept him in the State of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; for, for Lands <hi>Jure perſonae,</hi> or hereditary at Common Law, the rule of Law extends not to it, as I conceive; therefore the King cannot be diſſeiſed; and many other ſuch things, as the goods of Felons, murderers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is, or may be juſt in murder in ſome ſort (but in no caſe in Felony, but they ought to go to the perſon wronged) and in manſlaughter, and defence of a mans own perſon, there ought to be no right to the Checkquer, not in the Self-defence at all; and in the others it ought to go to the party; for if the Law in forceable ſtrikeing give dammage, and more in wounding, and more in Maihem, then moſt in killing, where the life of the criminal is ſaved.</p>
                     <p>That of Deodands is in the Law; and I ſee no warrant for it, but the meer alluſive
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105181:74"/> equity of the Judicial: It is alſo ſaid to be a part of the Kings Prerogative to have ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Iudges to try the right of his revenues as is the Checkquer; and the differences of his immediate Officers and ſervants, as the Steward and Marſhal of his houſe; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Action againſt his perſon, The Law by the Ordinance of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, for honor ſake, framed it in nature of a Petition; but the Proceſs was as againſt an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon; and ſo if Iuſtice be upon that, it is juſt, otherwiſe not; it will alſo admit no wager of Law againſt him, and which proved a great abuſe, and was unjuſt; and is no way either honorary or neceſſary; he did take men under pretence of being his debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, into his protection to the overthrow of many particular perſons and univerſal detriment; thus was Derogative.</p>
                     <p>Again, Judgment was never final againſt him, but with a figmentitious advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous evaſion of a ſaving his right; and this was alſo new and not neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>I come to two main and principal ſteps to the eminency of Prerogative, alwayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded the Supream power; which are, firſt, That the King hath by his publike truſt, power to do whatſoever there is no Law againſt; So that from hence hath ariſen the obſtructions to Laws upon new Cauſes; namely, ſetling that in the Law which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the King; and ſo abridging the Royal Tenure: By vertue of this he created Corporations, and made Denizens.</p>
                     <p>The other was (from Gods appointment to <hi>Moſes</hi> ſurely) to appoint places, ſo called, of Priviledge, like Cities of Refuge; but undoubtedly this was a civility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Kings and Popes, to raiſe a benefit to the King, by priviledging: That Charter had many Fees, and then the Pope made it by allowance a Sanctuary, and ſo ſecured by both powers; what can be doubted? that muſt be juſt where <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> joyn; and theſe men, both Pope and Prince did well, they ſaved the life, but ſqueiſed the purſe; and none affoord ſuch milke more freely then Rogues and Whores, as all Hiſtories evidence.</p>
                     <p>This is the ſumm of all the Prerogative ſo called; that I in this haſte remember, juſt, or unjuſt, that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> hold forth. The three main pillars upon which the Edifice of Prerogative ſtands, all theſe being but the Ornaments thereto, are the abſolute power to make Laws, War and Peace, and raiſe moneys.</p>
                     <p>Except in ſome few ſcattered judgements, ariſing upon Emergencies, and are not indeed worthy the name of Prerogative, though in our Topical heads of Laws, they be ſo ranked, but rather priviledges or Royalties; many of which were obtained by Subjects; for what a Subject may enjoy I count not Prerogative; therefore not Copning of money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor Royal fiſhes, nor a hundred matters of the like nature; and wreck is generally deteſtable, and the Royalty of grandage abominable; but the generalty of them are juſtly belonging to all men with the Supream Majeſty, eſpecially thoſe favors of errors in pleadings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this Legiſlative power was never in the King, nor no reaſon it ſhould; which alone ſhews the Kings in <hi>England</hi> never was ſince the eſtabliſhment of the three eſtates the Supream power; for the makeing of Laws was alwayes ſince in them, as the body Repreſentative of the Nation, and ſo the Lords and Commons were put as a Bar to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading Prerogative.</p>
                     <p>Next for war or peace, it was not in the Kings power; his Knights were bound ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Tenures, but not otherwayes; and the ſpecial of them not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their ſervice, were to be fined nowhere but in Parliament. The laſt of them which are the ſinews of the war, were always in the peoples hands, never denyed by any King, however ſubtilly obtruded upon, as by loans, privy Seals, &amp;c. which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways declaimed againſt, and damned by Parliaments.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were and are neceſſary to the Supream Power, but never truſted to <hi>Englands</hi> Kings, a ſure ſign the Supremacy was not in the King; he knew it neceſſary to aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize his power, and for an abſolute ſubjection of all intereſts to his, to claim that theſe were incident and appendixes to the Supremacy abſolute, which he aſpired unto.</p>
                     <p>And though the Forts, Ships, Magazines, and appointing Judges, Governors, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, &amp;c. were actually in his power; yet hereby it is plainly ſeen to what end, and how trayterous they were to the then true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſts, who ſtuck to the King againſt the Parliament in this war; but that controverſie is beſides my task here.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I proceed, and ſay that it is neceſſary ſtill, that the total and abſolute Supremacy hath theſe powers, <hi>viz.</hi> of making or giving forth Laws, making Leagues
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105181:75"/> offenſive and defenſive, denouncing Wars, and eſtabliſhing Peace, and alſo to raiſe moneys.</p>
                     <p>Now this I know not denied by any publike and approved Judgement; but theſe men have their bounds, their limits alſo; for general, common and publike good, is their limit, their chain, and to ſee the end of this, it is fit next to ſee</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="12" type="chapter">
                     <head>12. Who is Judge of publike good, and his Rule of Reſtraint? and whether it be fit to admit this abſolutely in the Supream Power?</head>
                     <p>THe Kings formerly were not unskilled in the iſſue of this myſtery, they boulted out what others will bake, who ever eats it.</p>
                     <p>Now it is plain, this alſo is required in the Supream Power; for it is impoſſible to ſettle particular Laws, ſutable to each particular occaſion; for in the corrupt ſtate of man, as the Law is profitable or diſprofitable, ſo it is relliſhed; as for example, in an equal rate, the juſt man likes the equality, and ſo doth the covetous; but he ſaith, no rate at all; and if an honeſt Miſer can be, he approves equality, but he repines at the payment.</p>
                     <p>Now the boundary is evident publike good, and of this in the manifeſt parts of it are all men Iudges; for though in tranſactions of the high affairs of State, the progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may not be fit to be made publike, yet the winding up as it is evident, ſo the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of that iſſue, may, as ſome conceive, fitly be accounted of, at leaſt to ſome ſpecially appointed, who are to be impowred to that particular end, as the <hi>Ephori</hi> or <hi>Spartan</hi> Court, who judged their Kings Actions, the Tribunes at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Democratie at <hi>Athens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this it is anſwered, That the condition of the Commonwealth, where the Rulers and Law givers are tranſient and perſonal, are naturally inclined to more equality in diſpenſations then Kings, who wholly labour to bring all to the power of their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, Princes like them; but the ſons of the other are like to be under government.</p>
                     <p>The other reply, that with all men preſent intereſt works; and power preſent may if not bound and limited, prove obnoxious, and for private reſpects, neglect publike profit in the Republike, as in the Monarchick State; for all are men; nay, experience hath manifeſted, that many Senators have been corrupted, to the betraying their eſtates to the Empire of a Foreigner; never yet a King, but to aſſure his Kingdom, and ſo he was not corrupted.</p>
                     <p>The other return that theſe accidents of the world do not at all conclude more then what was done; The ambition of moſt Princes hath made them true to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Covetize of ſome Senators made them falſe to their Country.</p>
                     <p>But the Queſtion here is onely of the abſolute judgement of the Supream Power, and that is concluded poſitively to reſt there in all dubious matters moſt unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; but for matters deſtructive to common good, or to common Juſtice, or againſt Reaſon, they are allowed to be accountable.</p>
                     <p>Yet it is again replied theſe were the boundaries before to Kings, and are the boundaries to all Powers; all have generally broken in all ſorts of Governments; the examples of ſubmiſſive accounting Supreams are rare; one was found in <hi>Rome,</hi> and one in <hi>Greece;</hi> and to finde two more in all the world is difficult; for who as theſe will be buried, and have their daughters married of the publike purſe, when they have the Treaſures of a Nation in their diſpoſe, and may benefit themſelves much with little or no hindrance to the State? Pitty it is, the injuſtice of great men ſhould give ſuch cauſe of ſuſpition; and folly were it while men may, not to ſet a bound; and not to ſet it in the firſt ſetlements, makes the propoſal for the future difficult, the eſtabliſhment dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: Therefore they propound, that the Law be eſtabliſhed as agreeable to the light of Nature, examples of other States, continued experience, and not againſt divine inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>The wiſe and juſt man will ſubmit to that in himſelf which he holds requiſite to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire from an other.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> allowed the King a Judgement of the neceſſity, but not che ſole Judgement, but that was becauſe the Supremacy was not abſolutely in him; and all held fit not to veſt abſolutely Supremacy anywhere but in Law; ſo that untill eſtabliſhed by Law, the matter is in queſtion.</p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:105181:75"/>
                     <p>And though the time paſt when the Legiſlative power depended upon the Kings will and pleaſure, by his calling or not calling Parliaments as he pleaſed, there might be ſome difficulty to ſettle dubious matters; yet that Bar broken, where can a let be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we convert our mercy into a judgement?</p>
                     <p>Upon all this it is plain that there are many difficulties in the nature of Prerogative, whereby to underſtand it clearly and truly. All States, that is, the Supremacy of power, do labor naturally to advance the ſo called Prerogative.</p>
                     <p>And the people generally ayme as much at liberty, but Kings moſt, and they more ſpecially where the Crowns go by way of ſucceſſion; for the great part of perſonal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of a King dyes in a State, except the Supream power will continue it (but then it is requiſite in ſuch an alteration to ſettle juſtly, and remedy fore-experienced and evidently foreſeen evils) therefore it is requiſite that the continued complaints of men, eſpecially againſt the Kings Butlers, the Clerks of the Pipe, Chequer, &amp;c. in their fees be ſetled; for the paying and gaining of a <hi>Quietus</hi> upon a duty to the King, is almoſt as much in Fees as the Rent it ſelf.

                     <p>NOw for this, it is plain, firſt that the Kings have done it, and theſe honours were never denyed; for, for moſt of them, generally the charge of obtaining, was as much to the Crown as the thing it ſelf; Therefore whereas they had Officers and Offices in every County, attended upon every Court, and ſome ſpecial Courts for Sea matters: The Kings did give theſe as rewards to their Nobles, and great men, within ſpecial Precincts, where in the primitive ſettlement of the Nation, their dwellings were, and ſo he was diſcharged of his Officers, and the due Courts were let down, and the Tryals were reduced all to his Court of Admiralty, which as in all caſes, was, and is, a burthen intolerable to the Subject, and to all impoveriſhed perſons Juſtice is by this turned into Gall and Vinegar, eſpecially to diſtreſſed perſons by Sea; for the poor people all along the Coaſt, are like ſo many Harpyes; wreck or no wreck, all that comes to their net is fiſh; and thus to ſave a little charge, we are infinitely inhumane; but by this it is plain, all but the power of making Laws, war and peace, levying Moneys, and ſome ſay Royal Mines, are grantable by the Supream Power.</p>
                     <p>Provided that due means of Tryal of Right be preſerved for the publique benefit; otherwayes not.</p>
                     <p>Some ſay, that this is generally true, that is, the Supream Magiſtrate hath power in all Laws meerly Civil; but in caſes religious, or wherein properly the conſcience may, ſome ſay does ſcruple, the Magiſtrates power ceaſes; therefore it is fit to look a little at that, and quaere,</p>

                     <p>THey who make this controverſie, are not preſently to be thought enemies to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, nor enviers of Miniſterial Dignity.</p>
                     <p>Some have admitted the Popes Primacy, who have denyed his Supremacy; others have given Princes all power; ſome a Negative, but not an Affirmative power in ſo called Eccleſiaſticks or Church matters; others take away the Popes Primacy; for they take him away, equalizing all Paſtors, and that that ſpeciall deſignation befits no earthly perſon; others bind up the Magiſtrates hands wholly; ſome by denying Magiſtracie; others by reſtraining him wholly to the name of Civils, not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently caring for (by aſſured and preventive means) thoſe errors which have heretofore clouded the excellency of Magiſtracie by the pride of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                     <p>For were inherent holineſs viſibly and ſetledly, and ſo infallibly tyed to either of theſe, the Supremacy were determined; but while they are all men, they muſt have their bounds and limits.</p>

                     <p>Yet in the Kingdomes of the world, the Prince muſt bear ſway, and hath the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence; The Heathens in glory of the Prince annexed the Prieſtly Office to the Superior Power, not the Kings to the Prieſts; and under Gods Law, <hi>Moſes</hi> was <hi>Aarons</hi> Prince or Father, <hi>Aaron Moſes</hi> Prophet.</p>
                     <p>Next the Civil part of Judicature was ever, and now is clear and manifeſt, except where intereſt or humour prevails, and let that humour alone, and it is ready to ſwarm into intereſt immediatly.</p>
                     <p>But this you will ſay determines the firſt part of the Queſtion, but the latter is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined.</p>
                     <p>To that it is generally anſwered, that what power is neceſſary for the preſervation of the peace of the Nation or Government, is proper to the Supream Magiſtrate; but an obliging power, that is, that ſimple obedience is to be given to his determination of but dubious matters in points of either Doctrine or pure Church-Diſcipline, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve never was nor will be yielded to him, in matters circumſtantially Religious; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe barely civil, was, as generally agreed, and will not now be denyed, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time of Congregating, the place, and other Circumſtantials for preſervation of the peace of Church and Commonwealth; yea, if it were upon good reaſon, the number that were to congregate, provided there were enough to conſtitute a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, might be ſet by the Supream Magiſtrate, and Chriſtians bound to obey; but this is only as keeper of the firſt Table, not of the ſecond.</p>
                     <p>Now to clear this, it is to be known, that if it be taken to be the Keeper of the two Tables, ſo called, to promote by all lawful means the glory of God, as the good of men, as all good and juſt Magiſtrates will and ought, yea if it be by preaching himſelf, or themſelves, and that either by word or Doctrine as good life, they and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are the keepers of both Tables, and he or they as ſupream in power, and ſo as more entruſted with means by God, to do moſt for God, then he or they who have the ſupremacy, are by way of eminency the ſpecial keepers of them, but that they are deſigned more eſpecially to repreſent either the Kingly, Prieſtly, or Prophetical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Lord Chriſt as head of his Church, without the manifeſt tokens of more eſpecial Grace and divine Revelation, whereby to periodize the Controverſies of their own Subjects, holding forth to us under the ſame rule the will of God as the Prieſts under the Law, is not eaſily diſcerned, nor will I beleeve be ſtrenuouſly urged.</p>

                     <p>THis is a great &amp; weighty controverſie; truly Magiſtrates that deſire to be flattered, ſtand off, you can hear nothing ſafely; for your ſafety is your danger; Now what we have ſaid before, tends much to the illuſtration of this point, that is, the due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the end for which Magiſtracie is ordained, (for by the Law of pure Naturals no one is above another) namely the preſerving few againſt many, weak againſt ſtrong, and right againſt wrong, in Scripture phraſe to be a terror to the evil; and to that end not to wear the Sword in vain; ſo that while evils are or may be, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie is neceſſary to be.</p>
                     <p>Now generally the defects and failings of Governors in themſelves, are not ſimply and alone a cauſe of neglect of obedience to them, or the Laws by them; for evil men may be good Magiſtrates; but in caſe the Magiſtrate ſeeks to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105181:76"/> laws, and all Righteous Government, altering or croſſing wholly the end of his ordination; it is in this caſe clear he is not a Magiſtrate, but he is a Tyrant, an uſurper, an Enemy to Juſtice; but then it is beleeved by ſome, that the light or interpretation of this defection is in every man, and ſo each man judges, and may juſtly withdraw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and oppoſe. This is groſs ignorance; no then every unjuſt man puniſhed, would be ready to rebell, and miſcall his deficiency Revenge of injury to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</p>
                     <p>The Pope by the evill management among Princes of this quarrel, brought the deciſion of all theſe controverſies to his Tribunal, and by the ſteps of ſeeming juſtice, mounted the Chayre of Antichriſt; for he finding that the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Pride, Luſt, Covetize of earthly gods, had raiſed up men againſt them, and that many halings and pullings were, between the Princes and Potentates of the earth and their Subjects, the one to have all the power in their own hands, the others to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend what they called ſometimes Priviledges, ſometimes juſt Rights; one while the inheritance of their Anceſtors, as what they had contended for and delivered to them, ſealed with their blood; otherwhile their proper and natural birthright, as dues to the people, which no Power or Uſurpation of a Prince could diveſt them of; he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litickly holding forth the neceſſity of an Umpire, got abſolutely into the Chayr of preheminence, and depoſed Kings for pleaſure, and Kings and Emperors and all for his profit.</p>
                     <p>Who would beleeve, that now after five thouſand years experience, the world ſhould not be able to unriddle this myſtery? the ſource of all our controverſies is the Judicials not rightly underſtood; for aſſuredly, the Acts of their Kings is no rule for us or ours; we are to follow them no further then they follow the light, which God gives us all to walk by, that is, if you will look at their King, it muſt be as bounded, not as imitating the Kings of the Nations, as not exalting himſelf over his brethren, not as taking away the excellent young men and beautiful Maidens to be his ſervants; and if ſo that he be under a Rule, then he is not to rule, not onely not evilly, but not ſo well as he preſumes he might, unleſs it be made parcell of his Rule.</p>
                     <p>But if he breaks this Rule, who ſhall enforce?</p>
                     <p>Now in this caſe it is plain, that a Prince, Ruler, or inferiour Magiſtrate, doing greater good then his Rule limits, is in an error, eſpecially if opportunity were of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that enacted into a Law; for men are men; and to do ſo, opens a door of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie 'twixt him and his people.</p>
                     <p>Next it ſtands as a preſident to his Succeſſor; Laſtly, it abſolutely intimates either a neglect of the Law, or ſeeking freedom by degrees from it; but if this were evill or detrimental, what remedy?</p>
                     <p>To clear this, there muſt be a difference taken betwixt things partly deſtructive to the end of well reigning, and wholly; for unleſs wholly deſtructive, threatning the whole community, there is no cauſe evident; but grant it ſo, we muſt then ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prince be an abſolute Monarch or limited; If abſolute, then it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the greater difficulty; for there being no barr in ſuch caſes, betwixt the Prince and luſt, the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the difference muſt be by the whole community, at leaſt the greater part; and if they break out, wo to the Commonwealth, &amp;c. It is the difficulty to do juſt things in ſuch extremities, not the injuſtice of the thing puts ſo many barrs in the way; and the evil truly is ſo great, that prudence hath totally waved a liberty of ſuch judgings, finding the dear rate Liberty is in ſuch caſes purchaſed at.</p>
                     <p>But ſome Princes have by renewed Tyrannies, truſting to their power, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced the multitude to laſh out, and great men for ſafetie to head them; but when matters come to this paſs, it is ſurely a judgement on both ſides.</p>
                     <p>Now all Chriſtian Princes held this, that they being all Typed out by the Judicials, they forſooth were abſolute Princes, anoynted with holy Oyle, and ſo apply all the Texts of <hi>Davids</hi> not daring to ſtretch out his hand againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> his heart ſmiting for cutting off the lap of his garment, hindering <hi>Abiſhai</hi> from killing him in his Tent; yet agreeing, the Lord had delivered him into his hand, and that after the Kingdom rent from him, and given by God to himſelf, and he with holy Oyle alſo anoynted.</p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:105181:77"/>
                     <p>And laſtly, for his ſlaying the <hi>Amalekite,</hi> who pretended to have killed <hi>Saul</hi> ahis requeſt, to themſelves, as anointed, &amp;c. and upon this they get the heart to trangreſs Laws at liberty, and even do what they luſted, yea inverted the juſt ends of univerſal good, for the enhanſig of abſolute power to their own ends only, neglecting the publike, claiming propriety in the Rights of the Nation, as in private inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though truly to that end alone any power abſolute or limited cannot be pretended to.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore I ſaid the evil of common Rebellions, &amp;c. hence ariſing, The Pope the Lord Chriſts ſervants ſervant becomes the decider of the controverſies of Princes, when the Lord himſelf would not be a Iudge amongſt ordinary men; and by this ſtring were the Princes of the Earth drawn to commit Fornication with this Whore, and ſhe thereby ſate upon many waters; but if ſo be that there be none but the Pope that hath right to depoſe Princes, ſurely they need never fear.</p>
                     <p>But in caſe they be limited Monarchs, ſuch as all Chriſtian Princes were, having their eſtates Judges of their Actions, whether they were called Dyets, Aſſemblies, Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Parliaments, they are to be judged by them.</p>
                     <p>Now to know whether they were Judges of their Actions, or not, it is only conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in whom the main and principal part of ſupremacy reſted, for making and annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Laws, war and peace, and raiſing Moneys.</p>
                     <p>For as theſe were intruſted, ſo was the ſupremacy and truſt of abſolute power more or leſs viſible; and if the Eſtates had the moſt, then no doubt they may call to account, yea and for ought I can ſee can be fetched from any the Texts aforeſaid, or any other, may be puniſhed, but not by <hi>David,</hi> no nor <hi>Abiſha,</hi> nor <hi>Davids</hi> ſix hundred; The caſe was perſonal as to all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo the enmity was private, and <hi>David</hi> and all theſe were but particular perſons, private men.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore to avoid the danger of general Concuſſions and Conquaſſions of a Commonwealth, ſetled in popular order, it is requiſite ſo to temper it, that the conſtant acting Magiſtrate may have a kind of ſuperadviſor, and the truly wiſe and honeſt will ſooneſt yield.</p>
                     <p>Such as would be Tyrants, if Kings, will only ſeek unlimited power in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths; let not this ſeem unreaſonable; to give preſidents were eaſie; but you will ſay facts prove not, I have given reaſon, and if that will not prevail, what will? the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are evident; give a divine word, and I am ſilent; for all Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> give obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Magiſtrates, and let every ſoul be ſubject, will bear no more water now to free wicked Magiſtrates from due puniſhment, how high in truſt ſoever, ſo the puniſhment be done duly, then that of <hi>Paul,</hi> Give not a Virgin in Marriage; Force may ſuppreſs the opinion, but wickedneſs of Magiſtrates will raiſe up their own ſtrengths againſt them; yea, their confidents will betray them; and if from hence you conclude I hold Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie a humane Ordinance, then you muſt agree to what I hold forth; for what man eſtabliſheth, man may pull down, alter, puniſh, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But I ſay, Magiſtracy is Gods Ordinance, eſtabliſhed for mans good, and by man admitted under various names and notions; which perſons and Offices particular, are the Conventions of men, either by force, which are void, or Conventional and by compact, which being civil, are and may be enforced.</p>
                     <p>Now this is to be known, that this is intended only ſtill in Civil matters, wherein juſt and good for the well being of men as men, is intended, not of power or obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in reſpect of Religious Duties.</p>
                     <p>There are, as I have ſaid before, evils in all States, through the pravity of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſo that it is not the form of Government, but the men, that in Religion and Reaſon gives forth bleſſings unto a State; and the degeneracie of men was never more then now, and never more then among ſo called Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Blame us not therefore, if we endeavor to beat out the truth; we have ſeen the glory of abſolute States, and alſo of limited ones, and that both in Royalties and Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; we know the vengeance of the Lord at the laſt, which he, we beleeve, will repay upon the heads of higheſt, proudeſt, ſtouteſt, yea and their children; alſo in outward calamities, whether one or more, whither Kings or States, all their abominations with judgements anſwerable to his Mercy; and upon this ground we are willing to let the Supream Power looſe.</p>
                     <p>We have ſeen the abuſes of theſe boundaries, and bars to Prerogative, and how they
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105181:77"/> have oft upon unjuſt grounds engaged people to wars, and brought great evils upon the Nations.</p>
                     <p>We have on the other hand ſeen the lawfulneſs of their Barrs, together with their conveniencies, tying up the ambitious nature of man, and as they were inſtituted, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preſerving a Nation from the gripes of a luſting Tyrant; yea under them we have ſeen the excellencies of Order, Government, Temperance, Chaſtity, Humility ſhine in Princes as in meaner men; and in the Chief Magiſtrates, as in the induſtrious ſo called Commoner.</p>
                     <p>We have lately ſeen at home, and do ſtill abroad, that great men in power put the evil day far away; and if they have no aw upon them but the general Audit at the laſt day, it is ſo far off their conſultations, that they are in a moſt lamentable woful caſe who find no mercy with them till that day.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the laſt part of this Queſtion, and that is how they are to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
                     <p>To which it is generally anſwered, That they who have the power abſolute, and can puniſh, have no rule but prudence, in enlarging or reſtraining them; they generally uſed baniſhment; but this in ſucceſſive or hereditary alterations, upon the ſame ground of prudence, cannot be ſafe; therefore ſome have immured them, and ſtarved them, ſome impriſoned them, ſome cloyſtered them, ſome privately murthered them; but all theſe were acts of pure power and force, and left but an implicite conſtruction of Juſtice on their actions.</p>
                     <p>Our new and unparallelled Tranſaction doth I know to many ſeem Heroick; and if eſtabliſhed by Law, upon this preſident, would be an admirable adventure, to hold an aw upon the ſpirits of great men; and to that end, they deſire the explanation of the ſupream (power or) Magiſtrates Truſts, and in what caſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſhall be lawful to arraign them, with the ſame legal proviſions as King <hi>Charls</hi> tyed his own hands in the Act for a Triennial Parliament; but I leave treating of this, leſt I grate to no purpoſe.

                     <head>16. What are the Priviledges of Parliaments, and in them of the Bars to the Supream Power?</head>
                     <p>FIrſt, we muſt conſider, that theſe meetings are according to the Rule of pure Native Law, by the advice of many, and thoſe duly elected out of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to avoid confuſion, to take care for the ſettlement of all thoſe errors, which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening time produced ſince ſuch an Aſſembly laſt Congregated; and that both as to the Actions (of the King in his Officers, where the King was held unqueſtionable, and therefore which was unjuſt in ſome part, his ſervants were puniſhed) of the higher Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and inferior Subjects, either in a legal way, according to the ordinary conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Nation, or extraordinary in caſe of emergencies, for which no Law was provided.</p>
                     <p>The examples are manifeſt in both; Now the priviledges of theſe men were, and ought ſo to be whereever ſuch bars are, firſt (that the due right of the ſubject might be preſerved) that thoſe who were to be of the Parliament were duly choſen, that is, neither by fear nor favor, which was from either open force, or private warnings or requeſts to the friends or dependants of great m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>, which were commands, (which how bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ſtill are even by Reformers themſelves to their ſhame not of Reformation is evident.)</p>
                     <p>The next priviledge is, that being choſen, they being now of ſpecial uſe and imployment for the publick, themſelves, horſes, goods, and menial ſervants, were priviledged from Arreſts, diſtreſſes, &amp;c. and only they, (for the law of entertaining by giving prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions was a diſpriviledge of the common Subjects, for whoſe ſake only they were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged) and no more (that other being but a meer Royal corruption, by degrees to make them all ſeekers of intereſts, upon that baſe Maxime that truſts were to their own benefit.)</p>
                     <p>The next was, to have free liberty to chuſe their Speaker, who was not to be diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed but upon good Cauſe, and that Cauſe they were Judges of; for all ſee elſe, the vanity of the formality, if the approbation be upon meer will; for then there is the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105181:78"/> power of Election, and this Speaker they may alſo upon good Cauſe put out, by the Votes of the greater number.</p>
                     <p>The next priviledge is, That they have a free liberty to treate of all matters; the aſſembling by Kings Writ, the being called his great Councel, are honors of Time, and formal, and cannot abridge their neceſſary liberty of free Treaty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But their power appears, in that they had the Guardianſhip of the peoples Lives, Liberties and Eſtates; and though in the variety of changes, they did as all mortal Powers do, ſometimes ſubmit, ſometimes inforce, as the condition of Times were; we muſt uſe a true foot, and aſcribe no more to them then is needful, not plead preſidents, but Supream reaſon, by which they therefore might and ought, during the forty dayes Seſſion, a convenient time (which by convention ſeems the time ſet, during which the King could not diſſolve them) to receive Petitions from all places, by turning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Committees, and hear how matters went with the Nation, upon ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations, from the particular Counties, Cities, and Town therein, addreſſed to the particular Members, choſen by them for the aid of the whole Nation; and upon theſe, to call ſome ſay the Kings, all agree all the Kings Officers of all ſorts to their Accounts, as Treaſurers, and that both for Land and Sea; yea Officers of Peace, as all Iudges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of War, as General, or Lord Marſhal, or by what other name, or names on Land; or Admiral, or <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at Sea, Captains of Forts; and all others, who managed the Revenues, ſo called, of the Crown, that is for the publike benefit; and this power is coincedent to every Bar to Supremacy.</p>
                     <p>And truely where this is not, it is eaſie to believe the Supream Majeſty may ſoon pretend all is intruſted to his own Will, and for his particular benefit: then they may adjudge, and ſentence, but not in Committees, but in the whole houſe; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there is no legal proceeding, and really and purely; this did, and was to reſt principally in the Repreſentatives of the people, who are the Commons, (the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Houſes as with us, and the ſingle power of the Lords to Iudge, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to accuſe, yet one Court, is much differing from excellent Reaſon, if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it) that ſo right might be done to the whole Commonwealth, againſt the out-breakings of the King, and alſo to every particular perſon by reſtitution againſt the wrong doer; yea, though by the Kings Command, or Commiſſion, if not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Law.</p>
                     <p>Now the limited times of Parliament were neceſſary, leſt otherwayes they ſhould abuſe their Power, or uſurp Supremacy abſolute, and alſo become deſperate debtors, becauſe of priviledge.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, that while being men and capable of erring, their falſe judgements, if any were, may be rectified by a new; for it was, and muſt be the priviledge of theſe higheſt Courts, not to have ought done there by any of the Members queſtioned in any other Court, onely Treaſon, Felony, and the Peace, which being flagitious, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Reaſon admitted no priviledge to; for how could ſuch enormous Tranſgreſſors of the Law be righteous Law-Makers?</p>
                     <p>The laſt priviledge is to have pay for their pains, by a (it ſhould be equal) rate, upon all the Freeholders in the County; that is, they who legally had, or might have had a Vote in the Choice; and this allowance was to be ſet by Parliament; and who could they better truſt with a little of their eſtate, then they whom they had formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted with the whole? and this was not due till the end of Parliament: So jealous is Reaſon of all Supremacy in the corrupted ſtate of mankinde.</p>
                     <p>And ſurely none that is not actually in this height, but will agree to this juſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and he that is in, if he intends onely a due uſe of it, cannot deny it, this is juſt, betwixt theſe powers and them for whom they are intruſted; for it is plain, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that all eminency of power, is ſolely and onely for the ſafety of the people; wherefore it is fit to ſee wherein that ſafety doth conſiſt, and to that end we ſhall Quaere.</p>

                     <p>HAving ſeen the great and due care of the Law, for the well providing for the Supream Magiſtrate, and that it looks at due (both) power and maintenance, and ſets limits in it ſelf againſt all exceſs and out-boundings;</p>
                     <p>We now come to ſee after the priviledge of the Subject in the body ſo called Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, the priviledge of every particular man, wherein the Supream reaſon hath alſo looked at every one but as a Member of the whole, and hath ſetled that as the greateſt priviledge, to do moſt for the publike welfare, and well and orderly government of all theſe, in ſuch ſort, as not onely the principles of Nature, but the long experience of of ſo many Ages, and above all the inlightenments of divine Wiſdom, have handled out to us in ſuch manner as they are without all queſtion.</p>
                     <p>And therefore as it is ſufficiently manifeſted, that particular men are through power, favor, riches, malice, and ſuch like, as ready and as deſirous to deal unfaithfully, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, and inhumanely with their neighbours, as the Prince with the people; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt excellent Reaſon, ſo called Law, and above all the divine Wiſdom hath held out Magiſtracy to preſerve as aforeſaid, againſt theſe evils by due Laws; and the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe, is the greateſt priviledge; and to have them like Gall and Wormwood is the higheſt diſpriviledge.</p>
                     <p>The ſpecial matter wherein we uſually place priviledge is, firſt, to Life; ſecondly, Liberty; thirdly, Goods; and fourthly, good Name; and the Law for good Cauſe reſtrains a mans ſelf in the abuſe or ill uſe of theſe, as well as preſerves them to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt others.</p>
                     <p>Now that which gives, is of more value and more honorable then that given: The Heathen expreſſed it thus, More glorious is it to rule Kings, ſet up, and pull down Kings, then be a King; whereby it is evident, That the priviledge of the Subject, is not to live at luſt, do as he liſts, revenge injuries, and act Will for Law, whether in higher or lower eſtate, that is, the Magiſtrate inferior to Tyrannize over the people without controll, nor to execute what laws he hath in his power as he liſt, but according to his rule; nor the ſubject to abuſe his fellow-Subject, in word or deed, much leſs to arraign the Magiſtrate and his actions with a forked tongue of envy at his pleaſure, no nor to miſuſe or abuſe his own time, his eſtate, his liberty or power in his place, and diſobey all Law, or at leſt queſtion and wrangle it, how juſt ſo ever, if contrary to his intereſt; and how plain ſo ever, yet to enter a contention meerly for pleaſure, and through his purſe-potency, to make evil good againſt his meaner, or leſs favoured neighbour; In ſhort, it is not to do what ever evil Cuſtome, or corrupt Practiſe, or Selfiſh intereſt calls Law and due right.

                     <p>Now ſuch, and the like Cheates, Thefts, yea as bad as Robberies, are not at all, or ſo ſlightly, and that with ſo much charge, puniſhed, as is too much ſhame for a Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nation holding forth common Juſtice to allow.</p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:105181:79"/>
                     <p>So the wretchedneſs of Juries, and the like, which are ſo clean perverted from the firſt inſtitution, that though many honeſt, juſt, wiſe Patriots eye the firſt inſtitution with great conſideration, yet they now ſee them with hearts of Regret, abuſed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing their high truſts, and all is pretended the liberty of the Subject: So far hath the corruption of intereſts prevailed upon all eſtates.</p>
                     <p>To rake in this puddle of Negative Priviledge, were to draw almoſt all the ordinary actions and litigations of the Commonwealth into queſtion, and arraign all perſons in our Apoſtate pretending Reforming Age.</p>
                     <p>I will not therefore expatiate, but come to the Affirmative part of the Queſtion, and ſee wherein the liberty of the Subject doth conſiſt properly, and conſider the ſame, as I have done the other, (though tacitely) generally and particularly.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore I ſay, that the priviledge of the Subject is to be governed by righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and equal Laws, the Magiſtrate executing without partiality, his power, in, and for the preſervation of life, goods, liberty, and good name, according to a juſt, known and manifeſt Law, for all enormities, tranſgreſſions, offences, and crimes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                     <p>This in general; In particular, it is to have the Supremacy of power ſo ſetled, known, and declared, both in point of Revenue, honor, and power, as conſiſts with the beſt ſafety of the whole; and that whether it be in a State Monarchical, or Republical.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the Laws by which they govern, be as far as may be certain, plain, and eaſie to be underſtood.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That this Law may extend to all offenders; and the higher the truſt, the greater the puniſhment; and the higher the injury, the greater the recompence.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That as the Laws be evaded, or difuſed, or miſuſed, or new evils encreaſe, for which no head Law is provided evidently; that this at the charge of the publike be ſpeedily remedied, that ſo the vitious nature of man may be deterred from acting old, or inventing new forms of ſinning.</p>
                     <p>That theſe Laws may extend to the Magiſtrate and Subject, Superior and Inferior in all degrees, Political, and Oeconomical; yea, to the ſuperadviſing the eſtates of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, vain, idle Spend-thrifts, (if ſuch ſhould grow in a decayed State of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which in a well ſetled eſtate cannot) as of perſons under age of management of their eſtates, or Ideots, or Lunaticks, for that vitiouſneſs in full ſence is worſe then in a depraved one;</p>
                     <p>Yea, To look to apparel and diet, eſpecially drinking, and alſo recreations, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called Gameing; for each mans time growing famouſly irregular ought to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by the publike Magiſtrate; and ſo in barganing and ſelling; yea, where a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium may be, to ſet it, or the Rule for it; Let not this onely be laid upon the preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Religion; No, the <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Romanes</hi> did by Nature ſuch things; and they without the Law becoming a Law to themſelves condemn us who have the Law and yet break it; is not deficiency of Judgement worſe then that of age? and the Law of property is not by this broken.</p>
                     <p>Again, It is the priviledge of the Subject, that they have fit Judges, Officers, and Miniſters of the Commonwealth, qualified according to the Rules of the Law; and can there be better then men of wiſdom, fearing God, and hating covetouſneſs?</p>
                     <p>Next, That their Salaries be ſuch as may be fitting for their places, and not burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the Commonwealth, nor their numbers, and yet enough; and thoſe fitly diſtributed for the eaſe of the poor, as juſtice to both them and the rich.</p>
                     <p>That all proſecutions in the Law, whether criminal, or other treſpaſſes, injuries, wrongs, or debts, be duly puniſhed, leſt the Land in general bear the burthen of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular offences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well knowing that there are abominations that bring deſolation; That the neceſſities of the Nation for War and Peace be levied equally and juſtly (and the expences in a ſetled way audited and allowed) and that not onely for, or upon man compared with man, but Townſhip with Townſhip, Hundred with Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and County with County.</p>
                     <p>The great reaſon of many Counties not going about, or ſo long delaying the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing rates, as to Towns and Perſons, was, leſt the injuſt intereſt of Parliament men, appointed for particular Counties, ſhould upon the true value of one County appearing, hoyſt that up, and never regard the due ballance with others; and therefore that the Law of righteouſneſs ought to be above the Law of intereſt, muſt, as may be, be aſſured.</p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:105181:79"/>
                     <p>As for example, If a Town were a poor ſmall Fiſhing Town, as great <hi>Yarmouth</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> was and not able to maintain a Miniſter, as it ſeems it was not, and that it had forty pounds <hi>per annum</hi> allowed for one out of the Biſhops lands; after it is able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ten Miniſters, and have but one or two, that it ſhould yet have the forty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> and other places ſtarve; to take this forty pound away, and make it pay duly an equal portion with others, is general and juſt priviledge, and no diſpriviledge.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Dunwich, Riſeing,</hi> and forty places in the Weſt, to ſend Burgeſſes to Parliament, is a diſpriviledge, though originally a due and rightly conſtituted; for the reaſon cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the Laws ought to ceaſe, and ſuch rechanges are our Settlements.</p>
                     <p>So ill Cuſtomes to be continued for Intereſt, and publike Grievances tolerated for private commodity, whether of men or Townſhips, as the unjuſt, illegal, and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive keeping the ſo called Aſſizes at <hi>Thetford</hi> at the Brink of the County of <hi>Norfolk in Confinio Comitatus,</hi> which is againſt Law, is a great diſpriviledge; for it ought to be in the body of the County, or Head-Town; but if that were ſeated inconveniently, yet this is unjuſt and deſtructive; for ſo incommodious is the place, that the very iſſues loſt there (the place not being able to receive the neceſſary attendants) are worth, or I am miſinformed by knowing men, as much as the revenue of the Town is worth; yet in driving on this corrupt intereſt againſt publike good, I hear good men and great pretenders are engaged.</p>
                     <p>And it carries little of weight, except for honorary intereſt ſake (which alwayes hitherto hath been an uſual inlet to corruption) That the Judge, a ſtranger to the County, ſhould appoint the place, or indeed that the place ſhould be but fixed, except in caſes of evident danger to the publike, as plague, famine, publike inundations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegings, devaſtations, or the like; ſo that of two accidental evils (not things abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely evil in themſelves) the leaſt might be choſen.</p>
                     <p>It is likely it will after appear better to take away the ſo called Aſſiſes, as to Trials of general actions, and ſuch controverſies altogether hereafter, as being now become a burthen, rather then eaſe to the Subject; for it is evident, the corruptions of thoſe meetings continue, if they do not increaſe; now ſuch things, which were good ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, when depraved, are diſpriviledges if after complaint continued.</p>
                     <p>And I wiſh therefore onely I could tell where the priviledge of Engliſhmen were; I know where it ſhould be, and it may be found thus by parcels; but there is ſo much rubbiſh and lumber amidſt the multitude of Officers, Courts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is hard, but we will attempt, as briefly as we may, to offer at leaſt, which will diſcover ſomewhat, though we cannot come through all particulars.</p>
                     <p>In a word Shortly then, Juſtice, and that both for Law and Equity ought to be in the proper County; the Officers known, Fees certain, and not exceeding ſo much upon the pound clear dammage; and equity ought not to be ſought till Common Law determines the thing fit onely for that Court.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, As to this, that no man be out-ballanced in Law, by power, favor, or riches, as Townſhips, Cities, and Corporations againſt a mean man, yea, if he had never a penny; nor awed from ſeeking juſt things for fear of forfeitures of his lands, as Coppy-holders; all of which I ſhall in their particulars further inlarge as occaſion offers.</p>
                     <p>So that it is plain here, That having and executing juſt Laws juſtly, whereby publike peace and ſafety, againſt the Superiors, and between equals, and well ordering Mannors and Eſtates, for publike peace, quiet, and benefit be obſerved, and renewed Laws, is the proper priviledge of the Subject.</p>
                     <p>But as to this point of ſafety, we muſt proceed a little further, and that is to look to the power of the Supream Magiſtrate in due providing for the peace and wellfare of the people, both among themſelves and alſo againſt others, not by way of Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polizing Trade for benefit or gain, but ſecurity of the State: therefore its no diſprivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Subject, that none ſhould ſell Ammunition or Weapons of any ſort, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Swords and Knives, but ſuch as are authorized by the State; So alſo that no one keep an Inn, Tavern, Victualing or Alehouſe, for that theſe houſes are, and ought to have the Magiſtrate their Superadviſors, and an account from them of the nature and number of their gueſts, leaſt any danger thereby ariſe to the State. And in caſe of error or default, the offender to be puniſhed; and in caſe of inconveniency, the place to be diſpriviledged. Again, Its no diſpriviledge to a Free-man to have men attainted of crimes ſeverely puniſhed; yea in ſome caſes, not agreeably to the letter of the (at
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105181:80"/> leaſt preſent practical) Law. As for example, a perſon dangerous and oft ſuſpected for criminal matters, as Robberies, Burglaries, Thefts, Cutpurſing, and the like, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted by the formal, ignorant, or packed Jury, for want of a clear, more then noon day evidence, which is now with Jurors, through the ſervile terrors of ſelfiſh Judges, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; if ſuch a one for the peace and welfare of the Publique be detained in Priſon, made to work, &amp;c. ſo one who hath had his Clergie ſeveral times; So of gallant Rogues, who live high, and can give no account how they come by their expences, to ſecure ſuch is no doubt the great priviledge of the Subject.</p>
                     <p>Theſe matters can never prove prejudicial to juſt or good men in a well ordered State; they tend to the well ſetling of any State; and although ſome may abuſe ſuch power againſt good men, ſometimes; yet this is well known, That that is the evil of men, not of the power; puniſh the men, and appoint better; but neceſſary power muſt alwayes be upheld.</p>
                     <p>This may be much oppoſed by ſome whom I have found earneſtly to contend that priſoners convict of Theft and Vagrancie, common Milchers and Pilferers could not by the Law be polled, that is, have their long haire cut off, no not when it hath been proved they have made that inſtrumental to their roguery. The Cuſtome of old will not prevail, but their new fancy, that nothing of reaſon is Law, but what we have an adjudged caſe for; this muſt be maintained; for this is their <hi>Diana,</hi> who ſo ſtickle for Rogues; and therefore they will not do this; but advantageous cuſtomes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived or created, though no better and leſs reaſon; thus they Tyth Mint, Anniſe, &amp;c. Its no diſpriviledge to be enforced to plant; yea, if a Law were to plant the North and Weſt ſide of each incloſure with fruit trees, and the South and Eaſt with Timber and other wood; and when any Cloſe were above four Acres, to have one row of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or fruit in or about the midſt.</p>
                     <p>It were no diſpriviledge to have all Commons incloſed and improved, a certain quantity only kept for the meer poor of the Town; nay its the only way to advance the Nation, provide aſſuredly for the poor, who now all are eaten out by one rich Clown; and make good roads for Trade, and take away the Nurſe of poverty.</p>
                     <p>Its no diſpriviledge to alter the Heatheniſh days of the Moneths and weeks, and idolatrous ones of Saints dayes, Feaſts, weeks, &amp;c. Nor to admit no Market or Fayr of ſpeciall note, ſave on Wedneſdays and Thurſdays, ſo called, that going and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be not at all on the Lords Day; No, nor to take away multitudes of old needleſs Fayrs in <hi>England,</hi> the principal end as practiſed, being only drinking and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs.</p>
                     <p>Its no diſpriviledge, to have a Law, that no ground within a certain ſpace of a City or walled Town be plowed, but all for paſture, except allowed, and that onely once in a ſet quantity of years by the Magiſtrate thereto appointed for neceſſity, and then not, except only for Roots, Turnips, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Its no diſpriviledge to be puniſhed for keeping Swine, or uſing certain Trades in the heart or great ſtreets, or neer thereto, of Cities and great Towns; alwayes provided they be not tolerated under a rent or any payment; to be enforced to ſweep ſtreets, cleanſe Vaults, avoid Dunghils; yea if it did extend to the avoiding or purging the belly of other excrements then water, in any place, and not bury it.</p>
                     <p>Its no diſpriviledge to have the Magiſtrate ſet a rate upon what can admit it, nor to puniſh the inventors or wearers of new Faſhions.</p>
                     <p>Its no diſpriviledge to enforce by Law to Tyle or Slate all houſes in Cities and great Towns.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, a general Law can be no diſpriviledge, nor any Law which truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends publique good; the not equal adminiſtring of that Law, is a diſpriviledge; but then the fault is in the Judge, not in the Law, though it may prove very burthenſome (as in times of Prerogative) nay deſtructive to a particular, which evil will and ought to have a ſpeedy remedy by complaint and due puniſhment, not by alteration of the Law.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the laſt controverſie of Priviledge and diſpriviledge that I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that is, That men of ſuch Eſtates ſhall not (keep Hawks) keep Greyhounds, Guns, ſetting Dogs, Nets, and the like; many have queſtioned me what benefit we had by all our labours, hazzards, payments, &amp;c. if this were practiſed, they had as live the Lord <hi>Matravers</hi> ſhould take away their goods, as the Juſtices of the Peace; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105181:80"/> informed, what they did was according to Act of Parliament, what he did by meer power; what he did was to break the hearts of the people, and fit them for ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; what the Juſtice did was to reſtrain the vanity of youth, and keep poor people to labor, that through the vain delights of ſporting they might not neglect their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; what he did, was to enſlave poor and rich equally; what they did, was only to regulate exorbitancy, and looked onely at inconvenience; they all reſolved the thing was juſt, they would willingly ſubmit, and deſired a certain enforcement of ſo juſt, ſo neceſſary a Law. 2. That trade ſhould be regulated; which moſt aſſuredly, as to well working, making, fitting, and trimming of matter, is out of all doubt neceſſary, if not of neceſſity; but as to the times and places of ſale, wherein one Merchant or Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may outreach another, and may border upon particular intereſt, that is not ſo eaſily determined; only this the Supream Magiſtrate muſt take a note of direction, that there is two evils which to well ſettle a free trade muſt be provided againſt; Firſt, to looſe a rule which is to place the ſuperintendencie of power in the vulgar Artificer, which will at leaſt end in confuſion; the next is too ſtrict a Rule, giving the Maſters of the Company as you may call them, ſuch a power as they ſhall make Laws, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the execution upon ſuch terms as ſhall out all Freedom, but only in name; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome general Rules muſt be laid down, and every County muſt have a Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Liberties of Trade, to reſtrain from unjuſt encroachments, either of the poor by multitudes, or rich by power; and this will ſurelieſt ſettle the foundations of all Priviledges.</p>
                     <p>But there is one Priviledge more yet remaining, which is as it were the eſſence of all, or rather that which in the enmity of the world doth ſecure all the reſt; and that is, that the Subject himſelf (unleſs he forfeits his liberty) be maſter of his proper Arms, and imployed in the ſetled Militia of the Nation; For it is by too frequent experience manifeſted, that the conſtant uſe or generall imployment of Forreigners (or meer hirelings, though of their own Nation) is an introductive to pure or meer vaſſalage; and ſurely you <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> who think Arms beneath you, as moſt of you of late years have done, are only fit, (as men I ſpeak it) to be the ſervants ſervants whom you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in that ſo eminently powerful ſervice; And ſurely, the loſs of a Nations glory, is, to enervate its Militia, by caſting the honors of that imployment upon men unworthy ſuch truſts, as if they and all other places fiduciary, and therefore more honourable, were only agreeable to rich men, which was done only to eaſe publick charges, and that made way for this publick ruine.</p>
                     <p>This I ſpeak to, as taking it for granted, that the time of the lawfulneſs of warrs ceaſe not among Chriſtians, nor that it will, ſo long as there is ſin and error; and ſo a Magiſtrate; for what the ordinary Sword cannot reach (yea the ſupream Magiſtrate himſelf in caſe he offend) The Sword of the Lord will. But I haſte, and therefore ſhall not enlarge, but open this more by another Quaere, which is,</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="18" type="chapter">
                     <head>Whether all Subjects have their Priviledges? And whether, and how they may loſe them and regain them?</head>
                     <p>IT is manifeſt to all men, as it hath before appeared, that there are Subjects by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and Contract, and by power; Nature gives like priviledges to all men; but it gives them not like hearts to ſeek after them; all accompt not priviledge the ſame; yea, we hear of them who eſteem it an honour to be ſlaves; but we look higher then thoſe Glo-worms; there is no fire or light in their reaſonings to us who ſay we have the Sun:</p>
                     <p>We therefore conſider the ſtate, firſt of men, who have joyned together to maintain or acquire freedome againſt Enemies or Invadors, and have been overcome.</p>
                     <p>Now here we hold them abſolutely bound to the Law of the Conqueror, and count it not natural wiſdom in caſe of utmoſt extremity of Tyranny to break out; they can claim nothing of juſt priviledge, they are his ſervants, they might have been killed, and to make them ſervants was a mercy.</p>
                     <p>And truly I ſee no way for juſt (take juſt for a prudent) heading of theſe men againſt the Conquerour; if for life, they have ſworn obedience; what have been
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105181:81"/> the iſſue of ſuch out-breakings, I paſs not of; matters of fact prove nothing, and this conqueſt without an Oath, if he uſes them but as men preſerved, ingages to faithful ſervice untill freedom acquired; their priviledge is to live.</p>
                     <p>And if an equal gets power over his own Nation, it is the ſame accounted, how unjuſt ſoever the ground of War firſt was. But in caſe of truſt convented for, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion granted, as to a Prince without Covenant, there it is otherwiſe. By this we now are come to juſt Originals of Government; here I ſay the people, the body, or evidently the Conſervators of the Truſts, or Guardians of the peoples Liberties, have a power to call to their aid, and vindicate if the Caſe requires, by Arms the peoples Liberties.</p>
                     <p>For here is rational ſubjection; and that which is moſt reaſonable in the ſingle Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is the Obligation of the Prince for his meer truſt; yet that reaſon muſt reſt in the judgement of the Prince; but this doth ſtretch no further then to things good, as in two evils the leaſt is to be choſen; but one man thinks this the leaſt, and an other that; and ſometimes that which was generally thought the leaſt, in the iſſue proves the greateſt; ſo in good, the Magiſtrate may think that, and the people this, but both evidently good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Magiſtrate may ſettle either; Now as the Magiſtrate is Judge of good, ſo is the ſubject of evil; that is, what is deſtructive to natural priviledges; for this ſubject voluntary ſubjects himſelf for well living, (the Subject to abſolute power is onely to live) untill convention either by Petition or force ingages the Prince.</p>
                     <p>Truth is, abſolute powers acquiring their power by force, have a law upon them, by God among Chriſtians, light of Nature amonſt Heathens, To do as he would be done unto; but he is while he hath not engaged himſelf free; but if engaged to man, bound to man; and man if he hath power againſt that power may enforce.</p>
                     <p>It will be objected; Princes will then onely ſeek to hold by Conqueſt and abſolute power and never come to any Convention.</p>
                     <p>To which it is anſwered, it is agreed they will not; for its eaſie to believe that men will not do what they never would be brought unto; We ſee Chriſtian Princes by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſeek abſolute liberty; yea, from the Oathes of their Coronation, which is the condition of the peoples ſubmiſſion; and whereever an Oath is, the people are free Subjects, if the Oath be required by the conſtitutions of the Nation, whether the Prince thinks ſo or not.</p>
                     <p>Now this is plain to him allows he end of Magiſtrates to be the peoples ſafety; ſo that the ſole difficulty will reſt upon the powers; but he that looks well into the work, will finde that the uſe of power is originally Magiſterial, or Magiſtratical rather; and that exceſſes of power, that is, that power which is not uſed and improved duly, is as ſubject to reſtraint as the failing of particular perſons.</p>
                     <p>So that then the powers muſt look to improve themſelves juſtly, both backward and forward; behind it ſhall ſee the Subject free in Nature, and happily before his inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, uſurpation, or juſt defence brought him to vaſſallage.</p>
                     <p>Now then looking at him as a Subject, he ought to yield him protection againſt all men, and then due means of ſubſiſtance, that is, ſuch as conſiſts with the juſt ſafety of the Conqueror, not contrary among Chriſtians to the Rule of Chriſtianity; alwayes yet preferring Self-ſafety; for undoubtedly we muſt agree, that if one hundred take one hundred and fifty, or but one hundred priſoners in War, and have three, or two hundred, or one hundred and fifty more come againſt them, and they can ſee no viſible way of ſafe ingageing againſt this three hundred, or two hundred, but by the death of them before priſoners, they may ſlay them, yea in cold blood; and they that have written otherwiſe, to aggrandize the mercy of a particular Prince, have flattered; for in War (if anywhere) my own life is above that of the Enemies.</p>
                     <p>And if Occurrences ſo fall out that ſome do not ſuch actions, it is rather the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate working of Providence, then the reaſon of man, or Rule of legal Prudence; for all know, the impriſoned will ſeek their liberty with the death of their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>
                     <p>And this makes many Conquerors hard-handed in the firſt generation after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, till the State be ſetled; and to give the due looſe to theſe men after ſetled by Conqueſt, is difficult; the men of the world are various in opinion, and much unſetled, they are at laſt forced to Providence; and yet who ſhews what Providence is? and vain it is to talke of Providence, untill we ſee what are the tokens of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:105181:81"/>
                     <p>Wherefore before I come to handle how particular men may loſe their priviledges; I ſhall a little diſcourſe of the tokens of Providence whereby a Nation may apprehend deliverances, and ſee whether there be any certain enough to engage a Chriſtian in what may be called oppoſition to Powers.</p>
                     <p>For to a Heathen to have power to try the event for Liberty, is enough to hold his conſcience in ſuſpence, till the iſſue to him manifeſt the preſent will of Providence; but to morrow he will attemp again.</p>
                     <p>But the Chriſtian ought to obey for conſcience ſake the Powers, knowing there are none but of God; and that he ſets up and plucks down whom and as he pleaſes; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſtians ſubmit to Vſurpers in Acts juſt and lawful, yea to Tyrants; and being enthralled, they ſeek liberty juſtly, that is,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When God ſhall upon their Petitions ſtir the heart of the Prince to afford them their juſt dues.</p>
                     <p>Next, They ſeek help of their Conſervators of Priviledges, if any be; but theſe are natural, and juſt to all men.</p>
                     <p>Again, Theſe ſeek not out evaſions for Rebellion, ſuch as ſome call Providence.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let us ſee further what we can finde in Reaſon; Let a Prince come to the height of private wickedneſs, is this a ſure ſign God hath rejected him? No ſure, let him err in many acts of Juſtice to particular perſons; yet this will not do, ſimply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; that is, if it ſtretches not to an univerſal end.</p>
                     <p>Now ſome would bound this to the life onely; that is, if the King, or any Supream, did not adventure upon the breach of Laws for ſafety of life, there ought to be no oppoſition.</p>
                     <p>Others make liberty, others call goods Priviledge; but all agree, that when he holds none of theſe, he loſeth the nature of a Prince, and is an Enemy, a <hi>Lycaon,</hi> a Wolfe, and with <hi>Lycaon</hi> or <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to be driven into the Wilderneſs till they know the moſt High reigneth over all the Kingdoms of the ſons of men, and giveth them to whom he pleaſeth; and that no Tribe, Family, Linage, or other relation can engage a Duty, but he will incline all hearts, as he did in ſeveral caſes among his own people.</p>
                     <p>Some Quaere this yet if it were ſo; and ſurely God may do it for Judgement: But O Kings, Princes, and all Supreams, know, while there is a body joyned to a ſoul, your foul exorbitances will not be continually brooked; but you having led the people into ſins with you, God will either puniſh you together, or one by another; therefore look not wholly to the ingageing the conſcience of your people, while yours have no bounds; yet this is certain, Providence is allowable in difficult caſes and doubful; if we be <hi>in bivio</hi> in a ſtreight, at a loſs, and Reaſon and Religion both ſeem ſilent, or ſpeak not out plain enough, Providences following juſt means, is a warranting ſign of approbation of the righteous God.</p>
                     <p>But in things evidently againſt the light of Religion, ſetled Law, and good Reaſon, Providences I ſay onely ſo (and moſt men expect no further) aſſure not at all.</p>
                     <p>Yet if effected and ſetled, we muſt obey; but till then it is our duty to oppoſe, which clears us of Turciſm.</p>
                     <p>By this it is clear and evident, That for any Nation to make an other its pattern meerly from Similitude is no way warrantable; but their ſeveral conditions, in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, not onely of Nature, but of civil Reaſon, is to be conſidered, leſt we ſwerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the puddle of confuſion, while we ſeek the pure ſtreams of Government, walking upon the ſlippery bank of Providence.</p>
                     <p>Theſe general heads paſſed, which will to ſome clear all the reſt; yet to all men of all capacities to which general ſort 'tis moſt fit for me to ſpeak to, I intend this Treatiſe.</p>
                     <p>We come now to ſee how particular men in their own free Nations, may become abſolutely bound, or more, or leſs.</p>
                     <p>Now to this it is plain, that as Nations may acquire power over Nations, ſo men over men; yet the generalty of Nations Chriſtian have avoided ſlavery, ſo called, of Chriſtians; but why they ſhould do it to others, is not apparent, except onely in the diſuſe, and that diſuſe come from the evil of ſervants multiplying to danger, as ſhall be made apparent afterwards.</p>
                     <p>But now, as ſome offences become dangerous to life, ſome to liberty, ſome to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105181:82"/> goods, and ſome to honor, ſome for a time, ſome for ever; as the Law is, ſo are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of men, loſt, or regained, and that juſtly; As the <hi>Romane</hi> Mutineers, ſome ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed into <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and never ſuffered to return, ſome but for ſeven years, ſome untill releaſed by the Senate, as they were guilty in degrees, juſt as now they are by Act made uncapable of office for one, two or more years, or for ever at the liberty of the Supream Magiſtrate; and ſurely ſuch penalties will, if prudently improved, prove the greater incentives to truſt and politique vertue.</p>
                     <p>Now as particular men are indulged, ſo are Nations, and by faithfulneſs or neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are incorporated into Free Societies, as Wales was with us, by which you have the wayes of regaining freedom made plain; the juſtice of them is before diſcuſſed; but the right of particular men, while acted in due courſe of Law, how ever uſurped upon, affords little matter, at leaſt at firſt to raiſe objections againſt the Supremacy of power.</p>
                     <p>This aſſerted, to clear all things, if it may be, we will briefly conſider the nature of ſubjection.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="19" type="chapter">
                     <head>Whether Subjection and Obedience be due to the Perſon, or to the Power? Whether it be local or univerſal, and how conſcience binds?</head>
                     <p>BY what hath been ſaid before, it plainly appears, that the Law doth, and muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the Office and Perſon of a Monarch, King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all other Supreams upon the like ground, by attributing to them properties incompatible, or no way agreeing with the perſon, not onely ubiquity and immortality, but alſo infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in their Sphears, that is, not to be able to do wrong, while obſerving their rule; this might be enough ro ſome men, if intereſts had not made us wiſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to the oppoſers we may ſeem to look back a little by reſolving conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence more clearly, That the intereſt of Princes (by all means ſeeking to avoid the eternal decree of altering Kingdoms at the pleaſure of the Almighty, by ſetting up, and pulling down at his pleaſure) ſeeking to tie the Subject to blinde obedience, as well in the univerſality, as particular perſons, without heſitation ſimply, becauſe commanded, is not held forth ſo much to aſſure the quiet of the people, as to exalt the abſolute power of Princes, to the diſhonor of God, and thraldom of Nations; And as before, either power or conſent giving this power, the ſame reſpectively may take it away, except it be a ſpecial Ordinance of God; which few, if any, do attempt to make good; neither can that Rule (upon any ground Scriptural or Rational, except God in Scripture giveth a liberty to things ſimply unlawful, which who dare aver?) of obeying, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by doing or ſuffering, be extended to whole communities, but to particulars, as aforeſaid, becauſe that Nature in the purity of it, intends univerſal good; and if the whole body of the Nation agree in it, it ſeems to be very evident; but in a knowing Nation, if the moſt knowing, it ſeems moſt reaſonable; but in a wiſe Nation, if the wiſdom be corrupted through licentiouſneſs, as to Gods glory it oft falls out, if the prudent of the Nation not carried away with theſe corruptions, agree it, and impowred, though not the greater number, it is lawful, but they caſt themſelves on Providence to ſupport them.</p>
                     <p>An other thing in this muſt be cleared, that is, to ſatisfie intereſt (<hi>viz.</hi>) what is the power? To which the Anſwer is at hand in a double conſideration.</p>
                     <p>To clear the Cauſe, You muſt conſider, that as perſons, ſo Powers alſo may be unjuſt.</p>
                     <p>Now to the firſt, It is clear, that Obedience is due to the power; That is, if an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer gets tht Kingdom, while the true King cannot yield protection, you are to give obedience; and if the Uſurper requires an Oath of fidelity onely, you are to yield to it, that is, lawfully may; but if he requires you to aſſert the lawfulneſs of his Title, it is unjuſt to ask, and for you to take, and ſeems onely a picking of a quarrel, to baniſh, or confiſcate, or <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he may do by his power.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay, what if the right King cometh again?</p>
                     <p>I ſay in ſuch a caſe, you in your place ought to ſeek the welfare of the Uſurper (if behaving himſelf juſtly) and ſo not condemned by the community; for I give no looſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105181:82"/> to particular conſcience, to judge of publick good or evil) if a Souldier by fighting for him, and ſo all in Truſts;</p>
                     <p>Then ſurely the Miniſter ought not to preach againſt him, though not for him, no not to hint ſuch matters.</p>
                     <p>And if he that thinks the Prince driven away hath Right, comes under the Sword of that Prince, his oath of fidelity is not extinct, but ſuſpended, until the right King hath totally ouſted the Uſurper; that Prince may put an oath of oppoſition to the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant upon him, but it ſeems not juſt.</p>
                     <p>Now the reaſon of this is becauſe God hath only appointed the Office, not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and power and convention are the means uſuall of acquiring, and God hath been ſeen in both; and man not to be wrecked or racked in his conſcience, muſt ſubmit when God hath determined.</p>
                     <p>Some men think the Prince is to be ſlain, and his poſterity rooted all out; but theſe men plow with the Devils Heifer; from this opinion have horrible cruelties, murthers, devaſtations, and inhumanities more then barbarous proceeded, and that among Chriſtians, to ſecure their unjuſt and alſo juſt acqueſts.</p>
                     <p>No, it is far ſafer to determine his rejection by ſuch a total expulſion, and make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience ſo far univerſal, not ſo meerly local after oath once taken; but he that thinks otherwiſe, and burthens his conſcience with it, ought to abide by that particular wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in doing what he can for the particular right he is engaged unto, until he either ſees him reſetled, and receives the recompence of his voluntary (I call it only ſo) faithfulneſs, or periſheth under the wrath of his Adverſary, or being better informed reconciles himſelf, and ſubmits to the power; now this is far more due in doubtful caſes, or where two powers both lawful conteſt, or where a lawful power is of many perſons, and part of them enter conteſt, and ſub due the other; This, as I take it, is ſufficiently cleared. I ſhall now proceed to clear other things.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="20" type="chapter">
                     <head>Whether Common Good may be enforced againſt particular Priviledge?</head>
                     <p>IT hath been ſhewed that univerſal good of mankind is the firſt matter eyed in the rule of excellent REaſon, ſo called Law; next that of Nations; and in Nations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the prudential ſettlements of their own, the Rule is, Good is more or leſs good as it more or leſs reſpects or reflects upon the publique intereſt and Common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, though the Spirit witneſſeth that it was done by Propheſie, yet the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the high Prieſt went no further then Common Safety, urging that it was better put the Lord Chriſt to death, then the Romanes ſhould come and take away the City and Nation; ſo the wiſe woman of <hi>Abel</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Sheba.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this is plain, that the life of a particular Citizen, is not to be valued with the ſafety of a City, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But put caſe, that a Prince requires unjuſt things, or denounces wars, may the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Kingdom, City, State, &amp;c. ſtand out? or if he requires the life of a particular Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, it may be him, in whom the ſafety of the place reſts, yea if it be the King of Right; as <hi>Jehu</hi> demanding <hi>Ahabs</hi> ſon, (it was before Crowned though in a Kingdom ſucceſſively eſtabliſhed) I ſay, it is meet in this caſe in prudence, to conſult ſecond cauſes throughly; they ſeem to do ſo; Two Kings ſay they ſtood not before him, how then ſhall we? And in caſe of extremity, they may deliver a juſt man, but not ſlay him (as they did <hi>Ahabs</hi> 70. ſons, that was wholly unwarrantable) life is the moſt precious.</p>
                     <p>Now to them that object they muſt ſtand out as long as they can, we ſay ſo to: but we may ſay prudence may avoid evidently ſoreſeen dangers, yea with the danger of ſome juſt men, to ſave many juſt men, and ſeemingly unjuſt.</p>
                     <p>For this caſe alſo the eſtates of particular men may be digged up, high wayes made through them, Bulwarks, Forts, &amp;c. reared, whereby property ſeems annulled, yet is only ſuſpended; but though the Law with us agrees this generally, yet our ſo called Municipal Law ſeems to deny it in ſeveral caſes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, though it ſeem to agree the Law as to Lands, yet it denyes it to ſo called per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal eſtate.</p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:105181:83"/>
                     <p>For ſuppoſe invaſion, as for example, the <hi>Scots</hi> (having now many Emiſſaries labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (in Pulpit and Preſs eſpecially) a ſubverſion of our new Commonwealth) invade <hi>England,</hi> the Governor of a Town may order erecting Forts, and for pulling down ſome houſes in the Suburbs, &amp;c. But for enforcing Moneys from him they know have abundance, and yet know no other means of ſupply, the Governor cannot do it, but by Parliament, he muſt be authorized.</p>
                     <p>But the reaſon is not thorow paced; for if Lands being the real eſtate hath the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, why ſhould the perſonal be better guarded? therefore to ſeek Caſes for the reaſon is fruitleſs.</p>
                     <p>Truth is, that the difference is not as the one is perſonal, and the other Real eſtate; but as the one is more properly the ſinews of war then the other, and more ſubiect to be irrecoverably loſt, and being private deſtroyes in ſearch the Law of property.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we ſhall not ſtate the caſe as the meer Lawyer doth, of forcing away money, but of impoſing Taxes, as for the preſervation of the place intruſted; And ſurely, though to avoid the uſurpation of Princes in the Jealouſie of Liberties, ſuch reſolutions have been; it is as lawful to lay juſt Taxes upon the eſtate, as to erect for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes by the labour of the Citizens, and charge them upon Guards, Watches, &amp;c. And to confiſcate eſtates, or inflict puniſhments, and that to death, upon obſtinate and deſerving offendors.</p>
                     <p>And this muſt be, or the folly, wilfulneſs, or pride of ſome few, may be inſtrument<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all by evil example, to render all deſperate, as too oft experience hath plainly manifeſted.</p>
                     <p>But the truth alſo is, that the ſufferings of particular perſons ought in equal Juſtice to have ſome ſort of compenſation, thoſe eſpecially which come from the own party, and not from enemies; for a full recompence if in all caſes, would but lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Civil Jarrs for intereſt ſake, in the pureſt Commonwealths, among men; and have therefore been avoided.</p>
                     <p>By this it is clear, that it is not ſo much the diverſity of Reaſon, as of intereſt, that hath brought forth this ſeeming Law of contradiction, both caſes being in time of eminent viſible danger, war at the door, allowed and acted by prudent and Juſt men.</p>
                     <p>Now in our caſe let us ſee whether the Subject may be ſo diſpriviledged in time of peace; This will not extend to life, but to liberty and eſtate onely, or moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly; As for example,</p>
                     <p>Commiſſions to Salt-peter-men to dig in the houſes, Cellars, Hoſteries, &amp;c. of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, and the like much Quaeried, as almoſt every thing is in preparations to great alterations of States.</p>
                     <p>So the putting down of Fayrs, cutting up of Woods in places of Robbery, making Cauſywayes through Marſhes or Fens of particular men, yea forcing the ſale of Lands, for works of publick neceſſity, or it may be of ſpecial convenience to the publick, as put the caſe upon the making of Salt, or to plant Sugar, or make Gunpowder, or the like.</p>
                     <p>Now there is no queſtion, but they who have ultimate power, have the liberty to enact Laws which ſhall with equall Juſtice relieve the publick neceſſity, and ſatisfie the Right and Claym of the proprietor, yea though he were obſtinate, not only not to admit the entry of his houſe, but alſo to convey away his Lands, without the ſcandal of <hi>Ahabs</hi> forcing away <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard; for no ſupream Power can do that either for honour, profit, or private pleaſure, without incurring a cenſure of unjuſt; onely the publick good, and that in a more then ordinary manner, can make ſuch Acts lawful.</p>
                     <p>For though we may have ſalt without the Nation, and ſo Gunpowder and Sugar, yet theſe being matters eſſential to the wel being of a Nation within it ſelf, may and ought to be, and will be provided for in a well governed State, to be prudently impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; And for Gunpowder, and ſuch like, the State may aſſuredly become the ſole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of it, both for making, vending, &amp;c. for ſuch things ought to be in the publick Cognizance, or there is little aſſurance:</p>
                     <p>Not that I would open a gap to Tyranny; for let unjuſt Rulers know God will find them out, and their own ſtore-houſes ſhal be made their enemies Magazines, but
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105181:83"/> to wicked men if they have power, you ſhall not need hint what is lawful; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard nought but intereſt; for the Judge of this common good I refer you to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Quaere of the ſame Nature; and having aſſerted that the chief priviledge of the ſubject is juſt Laws juſtly executed,</p>
                     <p>We come to handle the due execution of thoſe Laws, and Quaere,</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="21" type="chapter">
                     <head>How and where the Laws are to be Adminiſtred; and whether in the Native Tongue? &amp;c. and the times of Judgement.</head>
                     <p>I Find not any Nation in the world, but had ever their Laws in the Native Tongue, and in the due bounds of Cities, Counties, Provinces, or what you pleaſe to call them, except in caſe of Conqueſt, or abſolute power, though not at preſent conquering, yet claiming by conqueſt; and moſtly admitting no gradual appeals, but at a jump from the loweſt Judge to the ſupream; I agree an abundance of Reaſon in Grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and alſo of unreaſonableneſs; and as with us now practiſed, inſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Tyranny and Extortion in moſt caſes, while ſeeking Juſtice doubles the dammage original.</p>
                     <p>We all agree walking Courts deſtructive; and therefore our Anceſtors got thoſe of the Kings-Bench, and Common Pleas made ſedentary; and wherein lay their inſufferableneſs, but from the exceſſive expence of the ſuitor in Travail and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance? if ſo, then it is the duty of Judges in Chief, or Law-givers, ſo to ſettle judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories, that the remedy be not worſe then the diſeaſe; and be ſalutary, not only for the wronged, but to the Nation and people; for it is the duty of all members, much more the Supream ones of a Nation, to ſee to the evils and ſufferings, oppreſſions, cruelties and extortions acted againſt any fellow Citizen.</p>
                     <p>For what is this mans evil to day, if once made but a preſident, will be juſtified as of Right againſt another man to morrow; And if this be anywhere held forth in the Conſtitution of Government, it it moſt evident in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique.</p>
                     <p>We all agree the Law is our Rule of well living, and that each man ought to be puniſhed if he tranſgreſs; And the Law it ſelf ſaith, That no man ſhall be excuſed for his ignorance; And therefore Laws ought to be fitted both in the Tongue and phraſe to the meaneſt Capacity; otherwiſe the Law becometh a ſnare, as ours hath been too long.</p>
                     <p>And neither ought there to be ſo many, that a man may not well comprehend them; and multitudes of particular Laws is but Civil Popery, as well as holding them forth in an unknown Tongue; And ſure in reaſon it is as great an error and obliquity to the body and eſtate, to ſpeak to me the Law in an unknown Tongue, as to the ſoul. The open and evident reaſons of this myſtery is,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, ſetling the Law in <hi>French.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next the <hi>Roman</hi> yoak, making pleading in <hi>Latin;</hi> and the Reaſons making good this, is the pretext of Learning, which as to the <hi>French</hi> part can never be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; for it is an antiquated Language in it ſelf, now wholly diſuſed; and when uſed, then onely in one Province; but ours is neither written, pronounced, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as that old Idiome of <hi>Normandia</hi> was.</p>
                     <p>And our Lawyers, to make it wholly private, have uſed all means to draw it into the form of a Canting, or Gibberiſh; for it is puniſhable in Moots to pronounce in the true Dialect; but we muſt uſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> reading to the <hi>French</hi> writing, or rather <hi>French</hi> corrupted by ignorant Clerks, which rendred our books ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly imperfect, and even the beſt of them but by the ſence not to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warranted.</p>
                     <p>The private reaſons are, firſt, this breeds difficulty, that contention, and that gain to the practiſer.</p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:105181:84"/>
                     <p>The next is a quaint one, and would Juſtice and integrity warrant it, might bear ſome weight, but there is nothing in the ballance againſt Iuſtice but wind and duſt; This Machivellian reaſon is of the corrupt Court, <hi>viz.</hi> men by theſe private li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigations, wranglings and contentions, are fired in ſpirit each againſt other, and ſo are taken off projects againſt the publick peace of the Nation; but a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will eaſily beleeve this reaſon heightens both publick and private ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this blind reaſon makes no diſtinction betwixt poor and rich, juſt and wicked men; but put all to the Oare, and let them tug for Maſtery, and the Lawyer ſets on the bank, and with their labour is carried into the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean of ſo gotten riches; this I preſume ſufficiently evidences that the Laws ought to be without any queſtion in the Native Tongue, plain, and few, and nigh at hand.</p>
                     <p>Next let us know how we ſhould have them adminiſtred, wherein waving the private intereſts aforeſaid, the matter will be plain; for it is agreed on all ſides, That Iuſtice ought not to be delayed, no more then denyed, or ſold; the Subject deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this, had no more but Iuſtice, when it was granted in the ſo called <hi>Magna Charta.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now I ſuppoſe this delay muſt intend, not the cuſtomary time of lawing, but the due time, and that peremptorily, except in caſes of ſo called Eſſoyn, that is, when ſuch due caſe in Law appears, as all reaſon muſt agree there can be no proceeding but with greater wrong to the other party, then the ſtay can be to this, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; but the truth is, to have ſo many reiterated ſummons, formal and coſtly, for ſmall cauſes, is, yea though it were Law, that is formerly ſo either eſtabliſhed or practiſed, unfit to be ſo continued.</p>
                     <p>And in many caſes, formal proceſſes are vain, dilatory and ruinous; and the Subjects priviledge is (that is juſt mens) to have all ſuch excreſcences cut off, and meet Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine applyed to the wound; the want of which, after ſo many Vows, Covenants, Promiſes, Engagements, &amp;c. giveth ſpirit to the enemy, and ſets an edge upon their reproaches, and deadens the hearts of all true friends to Iuſtice and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>Some Nations would never ſuffer the Sun to riſe upon a crime unpuniſhed, committed after the Sun went down; and ſo not go down before puniſhed, if acted after Sun-riſe; you muſt ſuppoſe complained of, and poſſible to be effected.</p>
                     <p>But the meaning is, their puniſhment was immediate; others gave three days, others fourteen dayes: Now the beſt men alwayes give the leaſt time, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; delayes, whether in criminall or Civil Caſes, alwayes are the nouriſhers of corrupt ends, if not perjuries; our Judicatories are for Civil Caſes in ſome places weekly; but the buſineſs in formality depends a quarter, half, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a whole year; let there be juſtice done under a penalty: Now the trick is, delay till the Witneſs be gone, or hath forgotten it, or can be wrought off, or the Jury fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the turn.</p>
                     <p>The Heathens abhorred what Chriſtians practice, for the Criminal part; the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are or ought to be four times in the year; but the now Lawyers are ſo afraid of their own Law; for it is ſo doubtful, that few but the Superiour Judges (who by reaſon of their places muſt) do or will underſtand it.</p>
                     <p>And hence men for ordinary acts lie ſometimes twelve moneths, two years in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by Adjournments, and no penalty upon the Iudge; for he is ſeldom evidently faulty, but the Clerks; no Commiſſion to try him, or a defective one, whereby the priſoner is without all Remedy.</p>
                     <p>Next the Proceſſes for the Tryal before the Iudges, are not every mans purchaſe, and the appeal being onely to <hi>London,</hi> the charge which rich men and free men count nothing of, is to poor men deſtructive and unſufferable.</p>
                     <p>And we had need call for ſetled Courts and Laws, and the Judges to determine by a day, under a Fine or Penalty; for in Arbitrary ones, and ſo remote as <hi>London</hi> from many parts, and the Clyent muſt go himſelf, or his caſe is loſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:105181:84"/> and undone, where orders are gotten to day, and then the party out of Town, revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to morrow, and Order upon Order, Term after Term, and Judges ſittings uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, onely when they can be perſwaded together.</p>
                     <p>What is it but the Abyſs of confuſion, and that which threats moſt direful plagues and judgements to the Nation? let the honour of the Nation be never ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, yea though theſe acts were done to enemies both of God and men ſolely and onely; For pure and holy Juſtice is proſtituted, if not raviſhed, nay is then made the Bawd to each exorbitant paſſion and affection.</p>
                     <p>Wiſe and Juſt Law-givers muſt therefore ſettle Courts in due and fit places, times frequent and ordinary, yea if it were every day, and enforce proſecution under due penalties; And in caſe of appeals (while appeals) which in reſpect of difficulties, and that of moment, may be betwixt perſons mean and of ſmall ability, that they be ſetled in due places, and ordered in ſuch manner that Right may be done to the meaneſt, not as in the formal way of ſo called <hi>Forma Pauperis,</hi> and all the Proceſſes thence iſſuing, where the cauſe is determinable, all Dilatory Pleas excluded, and errors of courſe amended, and no error pleaded after iſſue joyned.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are principal priviledges of free Subjects; but indeed the higheſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt are leaſt underſtood, or regarded by the many.</p>
                     <p>Now whether theſe Laws be adminiſtred in the Towns, Hundreds, &amp;c. is in the Supream Magiſtrate; ſurely in the County and in a due place there, both for convenience of Travaile, and Reception of Suitors, not in <hi>Confinio Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reaſons for and againſt this, will not be worth the while, they holding forth nothing of moment, more then what is before declared; onely this, That by this means every County will have a various Law, and carried according to particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of places and perſons; but this is not be eſteemed; for we allow the Supream power the enacting the head Law.</p>
                     <p>So that the Law will be the ſame, though the diſpenſation may be diverſe then as it is now, and ever will be; for bind what you can, a wiſe Iudge will have or make to himſelf a latitude; but if truly wiſe, who will grudge? while Iuſtice indeed is his onely ayme and end.</p>
                     <p>But to avoid ſuch and the like Objections; If the Supream power ſettle County Courts, both for Law and equity; and admit once yearly itinerate Iudges, to receive the complaints of Suitors againſt all other Iudges; and for determining difficult matters in Law, after the manner of the now Aſſizes, it will take away all the grounds of intereſted objections againſt the neceſſary adminiſtrations of Provincial or County Juriſdictions, which ſome frame from the reaſons of County, as Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, Independency, or their ſeares of introducing the Churches giving an Analogicall Rule, at leaſt, of exteriour Governement, to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                     <p>Now having taken this ſhort view of the Laws Adminiſtration, let us in the next place conſider the Qualifications of the Law-giver, and Law-diſpenſer, whereby Iuſtice may be executed juſtly, and how to be choſen.</p>

                     <head>Qualifications neceſſary in Judges; who are to be their Electors; Judges Duties; and Defaults how to be puniſhed, and in them concerning all Officers of Truſt.</head>
                     <p>IUdges in all their degrees are in the heights of Civil Truſts, they are the Pillars in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of the Commonwealth; their general Duties are three.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to enact good Laws and juſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to ſee them duly executed.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, to alter them according to neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>All theſe belongs properly and more immediately to the ſupream Magiſtrate; but ſecondarily, and within limits, and according to power all ought to act; like the wheels in a Watch, the one ought to move the other; but the firſt mover hath the ſpecial truſt; for all move right or wrong as they do.</p>
                     <p>Now though the Judges be of ſeveral ſorts: yet all of them in ſome qualifications hold a Rule of proportion.</p>
                     <p>As firſt they ought really to be fit for the work to which they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted.</p>
                     <p>But this intimates plainly, that the higher the truſt, the more exactneſs is required; and the greater ſtrictneſs, upon legal enquiry, ought to be uſed in their both choyce and approbation. To ſettle humane things in a humane way perfectly, it is an error to conceive or attempt;</p>
                     <p>But to aime at the greateſt height of perfection poſſible, is a duty; therefore in the firſt place, all in places of eminent truſt, ought to be of full and fit age; firſt of full age, which is commonly reputed not under one and twenty years; for though a ripe wit may in the inventive part, in quickneſs of apprehenſion, and vivacity of ſpirit outgo another, yet in the diſquiſition of parts and ſetling the moſt convenient upon a ſure judgement, to which experience is requiſite, more years ſuit beſt, and are moſt approvable.</p>
                     <p>Now as too few years are light, neglective, and ſubject to raſhneſs, ſo alſo too many years are froward, heavy and ſubject to wilfulneſs; Therefore the beſt rule is for a wiſe Commonwealth to fix an age, before which, and after which, no one ſhall be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable (no not with a non obſtante) of ſuch truſts.</p>
                     <p>Our Law, however practized, and eſpecially in the ſupream truſts, holds forth ſuch a Rule; he that is not thought meet to rule himſelf, cannot be allowed to govern a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and if he cannot rule according to Law, how unfit is he to be a promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Law? And the beſt way is to make ſuch choyces abſolutely void.</p>
                     <p>For the exceſs of Age, ſixty is accounted a time to ceaſe Arms, and betake to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. I preſcribe not, but cannot finde a fitter. Nature may often ſhorten; She ſeldome lengthens that date with that Activity which is requiſite in all ſuch places.</p>
                     <p>Having done with the age, the next Qualification is ability, not of the body ſo much as of the mind; The ignorance of the Judge may be the ruine of the innocent; therefore it is not ſufficient that a man hath been Trained up in the profeſſion, nor hath been a Reader, no not if he ſpent one thouſand pound in the Kitchin; but he ought to be wiſe among wiſe men, who is to rule fools, then ſo much more if he be to rule wiſe men alſo, who may offend; and prudence may reclaim when power is contemned.</p>
                     <p>The next Qualification is, he muſt be free from all poſſible obligations to injuſtice in any kind; therefore it was unjuſt in the King to ſeek ſuch a dependance upon his meer will from the Judges, that they might thereby be drawn from the ſtreight path of Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>And it is the ſame in all other ſupreams; It is truth there is an upright man whom no temptation can miſlead; but we are to provide againſt errors; vertue needs no curb, the juſt man is a Law to himſelf.</p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:105181:85"/>
                     <p>Now it is known, Dependance is various in its workings, according to the nature of the man depending; for a timerous nature may ſervilely do the Princes Will, without any regard either to honor, or reward; but few ingenuous ſpirits are of that muddy temper; the great Miſleaders, are Pride or Ambition, Revenge or Anger, Coveteouſneſs or deſire of Gain.</p>
                     <p>Now there are to be Qualifications requiſite in every Judge againſt theſe; for theſe miſleadings vices, or any of them, will otherwiſe turn the publike Ax againſt the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Enemy; there is therefore great care to be taken at all times, in all choice of men to places of Truſt, but eſpecially in times of the ſhakings of Nations, for then the wiſe man muſt ſave the City, how unthought of, how poor ſoever.</p>
                     <p>Now to prevent theſe, the wiſdom of former Ages and Nations have all appointed a ſet and bountiful allowance for all Judges, which ſtirs up able and active ſpirits to eminency of vertue, (which can be never extraordinary, in a meer letter Law, where each Caſe particularly muſt have its examplar) All Nations heretofore agreed puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Judges, and all in the moſt excellent truſts, not onely uſeful but of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſome went ſo far, through the fear of Tyranny and Oppreſſion by men of eminent parts, that extraordinary abilities were obſcured; for the complaint admitted no Trial, Baniſhment muſt enſue; after-times tempered this <hi>Laconiciſm;</hi> finding it was the laying open the State to many Tyrants and Tyrannies to prevent one, that the thing it ſelf was the greateſt Tyrannie of all. This laſt Age went about by all means to explode any queſtion of Judges; nay, the Officers of Courts were ſo friended, that there was no ſeeking Juſtice againſt them; but of this more after.</p>
                     <p>In all Judicial places this is fit, That the Judge have his Salary ſet, his publike Fee from the Prince or State; now in this one word to this purpoſe (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>The Judge receiving this Fee from the State, this is a publike Fee, wherein each Subject hath his portion; and the duty of the Judge in it is, equally to care for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of both Prince and People or Subject; for the end and reſpect of Juſtice is not perſonal but univerſal; for the qualification of not Covetous, it is of neceſſity in a Iudge; therefore as before he is to have a due Salary; ſo he is not to take ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Salary, at leaſt as a Fee: There is much ſcandal at this day in Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths concerning Bribery.</p>
                     <p>In Turky it were no wonder, though till corruption through proſperity uſhered in the way, it was a wonder, and a ſtrange one among them; but that with them aſſures their fall near; for this is like a deadly ſore, which if in the Judges, infects the heart, at leaſt the prime vital parts of the Commonwealth, and then ſure death muſt follow.</p>
                     <p>Thefore it is requiſite to have this wound ſearched to the bottome; Some for this caſe have been ſo ſtrict, that they would not admir a Judge to hold familiarity with a father, or a brother.</p>
                     <p>Some not to take a meale, nor any gift, though never ſo ſmall; others have particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſet down what they may take; and that may do well if they peremptorily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that all not expreſſed is included in the negative.</p>
                     <p>From this I ſhall take liberty to exemplifie; It is not fit any Iudge receive a New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>years Gift, Gown, Cloth, Veniſon, Mutton, or the like, from any practizer at the Law, as well as from a Suiter at Law; for though I would not, nor can I aſperſe any in place of Authority, yet theſe things having been found evil and inconvenient, it is evident then that evil may be.</p>
                     <p>And as good men muſt ſhun the appearances of evil, ſo wiſe Magiſtrates muſt take away all things giving juſt occaſion of ſuſpition; therefore it is neceſſary, not onely to have theſe things ſetled by the publike Supream Magiſtrate, but alſo publiſhed, that ſo each man may know his duty; and for this caſe it is thought inconvenient any one that takes a particular Fee of any man to be intruſted judicially; for many aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have lain upon Iuſtices of Peace, Counſellors, whether deſervedly, or not, I cannot affirm; but it is juſtly ſuſpected, when they have been more fully informed of the Caſe, and pleaded more earneſtly then the retained Lawyer for his viſible Fee; but this is the preſent Opinion and thought of many, who alſo conceive it juſt, that a Iudge at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by Bribery, ſhould complain to a Iudge duely appointed, and the bribe-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer convicted to be puniſhed as well as the bribe-taker; for neither in the Politikes of Chriſtianity will be allowed.</p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:105181:86"/>
                     <p>The next Qualification of a Judge is fearing God in the Law; in the Goſpel it is the ſame, but hath many parts; for ſure his qualification ought at leſt to be as high as a (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed lay) Elder; then he muſt be in Church Communion, and not onely not given to filthy lucre, but ſober or grave in his behaviour, ruling well his own Family, (which now admitted, it is a hard matter to fill the ordinary ſeats in <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> for ſuch is the looſeneſs of all Government, that Government is eſteemed harſhneſs, cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, oppreſſion, tyranny, and worſe, if worſe may be;) but this is enough to a wiſe man; onely this, he muſt not be ſubject to Anger, that is overcome of it.</p>
                     <p>And it is the duty of the Chuſers of theſe men, not to ſatisfie themſelves ſleightly in theſe qualifications, nor of the people too readily to aſperſe; for unleſs defects be evident and notorious, Wiſdom will cover on the one hand, and fear of puniſhment, if that be readily allowed, bridle on the other; for there will be ſuch an awe upon ſpirits, that whom love of duty and vertue cannot prevail over, fear of vengeance will.</p>
                     <p>I come now to conſider by whom the Judges are to be appointed; to which it is eaſie to reſolve, That it properly belongs to the body Repreſentative, none fitter in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe, unleſs otherwiſe ordered by the Supream Power, according to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a Nation; for aſſuredly the chief Judges are the Arteries of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and therefore a due and juſt dependance upon the Supream Power is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, but never would the Supream look to all adminiſtrations.</p>
                     <p>And if Judges be in Provinces or Counties as is due, not onely the ſedentary at the elbow of the Supremacy, but the chief in the Counties, ought to be at leaſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and authoriſed (though the nomination may be in the County) by the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; but that all be done in this kinde, by an open plain known publike Law, is moſt requiſite.</p>
                     <p>Now before we come to the duties of Judges, we muſt ſhew the neceſſity of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Qualifications in Judges in point of due temper both of paſſions and affections; for it is before aſſerted, that the Judge muſt be bound by a head Law, which takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the pure <hi>Arbitrium,</hi> and alſo to puniſhments which he may not exceed, and that both corporal (and that as well to reſtraint of Liberty, as Correction ſo called) as criminal or purſ-paiment.</p>
                     <p>And this Prudence allows an extraordinary care in the due choice, or ſpeedy care in removeal of unfit Judges, which is that principally can free from diverſity of Laws, according to the divers natures of men, in regard of which diverſity of ſpirits as fierce and untractable, and quiet and meek, the Magiſtrate, as before, ought to have power above what is at all times and to all perſons fitting to be uſed.</p>
                     <p>We have ſeen that the want of this, and putting men for riches, or Family ſake, or other outward relations (as of breeding and the like, but no way improveing them) in place and honored with judicial truſts, yea though but a Juſtice of the Peace, hath made Juſtice it ſelf either from weakneſs or wickedneſs diſeſteemed; whereas let nothing draw from the natural rational Rule, and you ſhall ſee Juſtice carry that due Splendor and Majeſty, which properly belongs to thoſe who bear the Image of Gods name in a more eſpecial manner.</p>
                     <p>Among Judges, I alſo muſt intend not onely Juſtices of the Peace, but Conſtables, yea and Jurors, who now are made of men of no eſteem, and ſo juſtly diſeſteemed.</p>
                     <p>For Jurors, if they were but bare Judges of fact, yet in that they are Judges, and ought to have their qualifications accordingly; for eſtate in them it is neceſſary, becauſe their disburthen is by dammage.</p>
                     <p>But as to other qualifications, reſpectively as others; for the choiſe of Judges, as the the Supream ought to chuſe the next immediate; ſo it ſeems to ſome, that the Judges gradually ought to chuſe; but that ſavors more of form then ſubſtance; for the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lieth not in the Judgeſhip, but Supremacy, which if wholly in the order of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, devolves into Tyranny naturally, as on the other hand into confuſion if wholly in the populacy.</p>
                     <p>To place it in the Judges, is ſolely to eſtabliſh intereſt, which yet being moſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, is to be waved with greateſt ſeverity and care.</p>
                     <p>And it ſeemeth beſt to place the choice of inferior Judges in ſome certain men of the people, duly qualified with due regulations of neceſſity to be obſerved.</p>
                     <p>One word to their duty, which will on the contrary evidence defaults.</p>
                     <p>The duty of Judges therefore is twofold; firſt, to hold forth practically as well as
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105181:86"/> literally the true and proper ſenſe of the Law, and not to admit Formality, Practiſe, or Cuſtome againſt the letter, while the letter holds forth ought of Juſtice, in the ſetled State at leaſt; for that liberty brings all Laws into the meer will of the Judge.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, where they perceive error in Law, which gives juſt cauſe of exception, its their duty to declare the ſame publikely to the Supream Magiſtrate, with a fit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, whoſe duty it is to enact a due remedy, and eſtabliſh the ſame accordinly, if upon inquiſition the ſame be found juſt, otherwiſe not; and if they do not, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not the truſt repoſed in them; for the Supream Magiſtrate, though in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratike State (where moſt eyes and ears are at work, and jealouſies be higheſt) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern each dangerous obliquity in legal adminiſtrations; therefore they who are intruſted, ſhould in their places conſult for preventing evils as well as for remedying; and this is to have Judges as at firſt.</p>
                     <p>Their puniſhments cannot be preſcribed but according to the nature of other offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, life with life, dammage with dammage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But alwayes provided that the error was intentional, and except the guilt were notorious, to diſcharge upon Oath, but withall to loſe his place.</p>
                     <p>And to avoid all ſcruples concerning Magiſtrates Elections, as alſo for making and enacting due and fit Laws, and knowing the errors of Magiſtrates in all places, that there be reſpectively fixed places and ſure appointed into which it ſhould be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for any man after promulgation of a Law, or nomination of a Judge, to ſet down his Opinions and Reaſons, for, or againſt the altering, or annulling, or rejecting the Law or Judge, before the Law be eſtabliſhed, or the Judge confirmed, with a mark, no name to appear to make good if required upon the mark, otherwiſe the note to be rejected; and theſe kept by ſome ſworn men under ſtrict penalties.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not treat how far ignorance of any ſort excuſes; there is enough to hint the general reaſon before; I now proceed and Quaere</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="23" type="chapter">
                     <head>Whether the execution of Laws ought to be all after one maner, and all Courts to have the ſame Juriſdiction, Officers, Proceedings and Fees?</head>
                     <p>AS to the Execution of Laws, provided the head Rule be obſerved, that is, life to anſwer life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Aſſuredly the Magiſtrate hath the abſolute power to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate or inforce as he ſees ocaſion, (take execution for the way of puniſhing offenders in any kind;) but if you take it for the Uniformity or Identity of Law in all Counties, ſurely there the Law ought to be the ſame, if Reaſon be the ſame.</p>
                     <p>I dare not aſſert it of certainty to be of neceſſity that all Chriſtians live by the like particular Laws; but I believe that as Nature holds forth but one light to men, and God but one Law to Chriſtians; ſo that it is moſt clear, and the fitteſt way to avoid the ordinary jangles, as aforeſaid, to ſettle that head-Law as our Rule, and to draw by all juſt means to the like conſonancy of Reaſon in the diſtributive, as in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive part of Law.</p>
                     <p>And this doth not (as I in all humility conceive) at all claſh with theſe tling of Provincial Courts, while as before the whole Law flows from the ſame fountain of Supremacy in the head-pipe of ſedentary order of Judges, or a fit number to over-ſee the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by way of yearly Circuits, admitting, and determining Complaints, againſt even ordinary Judges, and that without or Fine or Fee, and determining matters difficult in Law, or referring it to conſulation, after; but determining without further expence, and in a certain time; for as before, the Judge, and ſo all Officers publike, ought to be paid out of the publike purſe; But theſe Judges alſo muſt be bounded what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents they may take, and from whom.</p>
                     <p>This will ſilence all jangles, and the Engliſhman ſhall know his Law wherever he cometh in his own Nation.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the ordinary Courts, or Hundreds, it is requiſite to have all Officers, proceedings, and fees alike; not that it is intended the Hundred Court ſhould have the ſame with the County, or <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or the Meſſenger that goes ten miles, no more then he that goes but two; nor he that ingroſſes or writes ten ſheets, as he that doth but five.</p>
                     <p>But at a due known allowed rate for all, eſtabliſhed by viſible and plain Law, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and in Print; and that in ſuch manner, that the long hanging of a Cauſe in Court,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105181:87"/> or multitude of Writs, or warnings of Juries ſhould not advantage Officers, or as bad as amerce Suitors.</p>
                     <p>But that the Judge be fineable; let the proſecutor be inforced to proceed, or his Caſe diſmiſſed with Fine for unjuſt clamor and litigation.</p>
                     <p>Next, all Writs or Proceſſes are to be had in the County, and all returnable at one time, be it one, two, three or four dayes or weeks.</p>

                     <head>How Appeals are to be admitted, and falſe Judgements remedied and puniſhed.</head>
                     <p>THis ſeems to receive ſatisfaction in ſome foregoing Conſiderations; but in regard that all cannot be ſaid at once, I ſhall ſhortly inlarge; Appealing (in this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion) is no more then the waving of the Court, and going to a higher, for ſo of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity it muſt be.</p>
                     <p>This I muſt agree is neceſſary; but though I allow Appeals, I admit not the many gradations.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why this grew ſo common, was, the meanneſs of Judges in County Courts, which was ordinarily put off with an Attorneyes man; but wiſe men will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the qualifications muſt be intended in righteous Judicatories, according to the truſt; therefore we will ſuppoſe the County ſupplied with able Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I thefore Quaere, what may cauſe an Appeal; may fear of injuſtice?</p>
                     <p>No, it ought not to be ſuppoſed.</p>
                     <p>But may greatneſs of dammage?</p>
                     <p>No; for the difficulty muſt be either matter of Fact or Law; for Fact, there ought not to be any removeal; rather let ſuch extraordinary Caſes (if what need not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, muſt be) be delayed, till the Itinerant Judges come down as now.</p>
                     <p>For the difficulties will be onely or ſpecially in Criminals; for other great doubts are generally Titles; and ſurely they are cuſtomarily made more difficult then they are; however particular right of particular perſons ought not to admiſt ſuch publike hurries, though gain hath guilded fair the rotten poſts of intereſted Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>But there may yet be Reaſons of Appeal, as in Caſe the ſuit ariſeth between one in the utmoſt bound North, with one in the utmoſt bound South, or in divers Counties.</p>
                     <p>Now this muſt have a Rule to ſettle in which County, as where the wrong was done, debt to be paid, or <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or elſe in a certain middle County; in caſe of not obſerving which Rule, an Appeal ought to be admitted to the Sedentary Judges out of their Circuits otherwaies in, and to be determined at their return, (or by the Judges of both Counties, if adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the bounds of the County where the wronged perſon dwels.)</p>
                     <p>But theſe Appeals are to be allowed under the hands of the Judges of the County, when admitted, and ſo by them transferred to the Superior; and if the Appeal be not juſtly grounded, and ſpeedily ordered, the Judge to be puniſhed, for that he is the Author of delay; but if upon conſultation the Caſe be difficult, there muſt be a Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate to the Superior Judges of the truth of the Caſe atteſted by the Complainer, who muſt make it good within a ſet time, or the Appeal to be quaſhed, and he fined, but the Judges excuſed.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the remedying of falſe Judgements, moſt certainly Writs of Error were juſtly made uſe of and allowed, and the notion of falſe judgement for ſo thought good reaſon waved, and ſo complaints ought to be as aforeſaid; but this muſt not attend the propounded Aſſiſes without ſatisfying the Judgment preſently, yea though it be falſe.</p>
                     <p>Next no error but to be allowed before the Writ iſſues forth; for to purchaſe the Writ of Courſe, and Aſſign one Error or more of courſe this Term, then more the next, and then a peremptory day, and then Errors Caſſed, is but legal extortion.</p>
                     <p>So that it is plain, to take errors totally away, is as bad as to have all allowed; but to prevent the miſchief, let a certain day in Court be to determine errors before iſſue, and not after.</p>
                     <p>Now the puniſhments in theſe defaults, are and muſt be pecuniary, and that both in the Judges of Fact as Jurors as well as Law; but where the default is evident, there ought to be a diſpriviledging for future as to all publike truſts (at leaſt for a time) but
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105181:87"/> out of the Judicial place preſently, yea though the oath be that he was onely miſtaken in Law, and did not do it at all maliciouſly, or with a minde of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Now to oaths, it is fit any Juſtice of the Peace ſhould give it at diſcretion; this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires able Judges, and ſo ſhould Judges be; but of this more in due place.</p>

                     <head>Concerning what things the Magiſtrate may and ought to make Laws.</head>
                     <p>YOu heard before, that there muſt reſt in ſome perſons thereto deſigned, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by God, as thoſe who claym to rule by abſolute power, or by men, as thoſe who rule by Compact or Convention, as who either had no power, but were meerly elected, and agreed with, having no Right primarily; or had ſome power, but not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and ſo condiſcended to ſome rule, that they might rule aſſuredly.</p>
                     <p>Now this being in one perſon, or more, yet the power ought to extend to all things juſtly neceſſary to the well being of a Commonwealth; and therefore they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively the general powers of war and peace, life and death.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe we have before hinted, that there was a neceſſity of the Magiſtrates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating of thoſe things which many men call diſpriviledge to Chriſtians as well as men, we will according to the rule before laid, that is of the head Law, according to Gods own Law, the God of Chriſtians as of the Jew, ſee the Government of reaſon laid there down both for Divine and Civil worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Wherein firſt it ſeems directly given to the Magiſtrate, to have the ordering of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip to God under the Law.</p>
                     <p>Now let us ſee how this works; for <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> is a Leper for acting in the Prieſts Office.</p>
                     <p>Yet the aberrations both of Prieſt and People are laid to the Kings charge; and the good Kings commanding juſt things, and not onely ſo, but ſeeing of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, are bleſſed; and on the contrary, the evil Kings puniſhed, and their Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: And thoſe diſobedient to the King, as (to <hi>Ahab</hi>) the ſeven thouſand that never bowed knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> were thoſe who were to take root downward, and bring forth fruit upward.</p>
                     <p>Now the great difficulty is, to ſettle the Magiſtrates power ſo that he may not bring ſin upon himſelf and the Nation, by commanding or tolerating things evil and unjuſt, or unjuſtly enforcing things juſt and good.</p>
                     <p>Now as to this, it is to be conſidered, that we all profeſs Grace is from Heaven, the meer gift of God, and that the Spirit breatheth where it pleaſeth, as the wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth where it liſteth; if ſo, the Magiſtrate,</p>
                     <p>Yea grant there were a clear Church Magiſtrate, that were by divine Word impowred with the Sword of <hi>Paul</hi> as the Keys of <hi>Peter;</hi> could he go further then the outward man? it is plain he could not.</p>
                     <p>Next then, grant no ſuch Magiſtrate, ſure the Civil (or in caſe of doubt of Spiritual Power) the Civil Magiſtrate onely can act clearly; Now for the Spiritual Power to be helped out with the Civil Sword, ſurely it is one of the groſſeſt vanities that Popery ever broached. God ſtands not in need of mans wiſdome or power.</p>
                     <p>But God having not cleared that the implicit conſtruction by Analogical or ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reaſon from the legall ſeverity is proportionate to the gentle and quiet brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Rule of the Goſpel, nor agreeable to the Commiſſion which our Saviour gives to his Apoſtles, which was either to the Jew, <hi>Matthew</hi> the 10. <hi>Mark</hi> the 3. and <hi>Luke</hi> the 9. or to the univerſality of men, <hi>Matthew</hi> the 28. <hi>Mark</hi> the 16. <hi>Luke</hi> the 24. and clear enough in that of the 21. of <hi>John</hi> and 15. where nothing is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of but preaching, and teaching, and feeding;</p>
                     <p>If then the Paſtor have not the Sword but of the Spirit, let us ſee the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and Magiſterial Sword which is not born in vain; what may this do?</p>
                     <p>If we look to the Jewiſh Model which many men ſeem ſo much to contend
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105181:88"/> for; There we ſee that the Magiſtrate had power over blaſphemers, Idolaters, and tempters to Idolatry, witches, &amp;c. and this extended to death, and that it ſhould do ſo with us, is by them deſired.</p>
                     <p>Now many ſuppoſe this difficulty, though very great, may be at leaſt in great part aſſoyled, if we conſider that the perſons to whom this Law was given, was a people choſen by wonderful miracles and wonders from all Nations, to be the people of God, and bear out to the world the Enſigns of his ſpecial love to man in all Ages and Generations; which tokens of love in obedience to his Law, were ſuited with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable judgements in the neglect of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>And ſurely thoſe things which relate immediately to God in the point of graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervice, hold forth nothing to us but aſſurance of eternal puniſhments to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentant ſinner. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſeth himſelf a blaſphemer, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> the 1. 13. and declaring in the laſt times what fearful and horrible ſins ſhould appear among men, 2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 3. 2. he takes notice of blaſphemy and bids onely <hi>from ſuch turn away.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if you would have a Magiſtrate to work without a divine precept, we muſt look at the height of improved reaſon; There we find that zeal for the Gods among all Heathens made blaſphemy death; and ſurely reverence is due by the light of Nature, to what ever is called God; Of blaſphemy under the Law, the Councell was Judge.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> was not of Prieſts; they might ask Councel of the Prieſt, but determined themſelves; and theſe by Gods Law put the blaſphemer to death; many conjecture upon this, the Devil Aped Gods Law, others his delight in blood hinted the Law, as in Heathen Sacrifices; but ſure ſuch reaſon makes againſt theſe objects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to take away the pure light of reaſon; for who that will acknowledge a Deity, will allow the Deity to be blaſphemed?</p>
                     <p>But now the doubt is, whether theſe are not under the Goſpel to be reſerved to the laſt Judgement.</p>
                     <p>Some beleeving, that if <hi>Paul</hi> of a blaſphemer (and who ever was a greater?) became a Saint, a Preacher of the Meſſiah, who did and thought to do many things againſt the Name of Jeſus (that is, againſt them called on his name) why may not any other be converted? where is Gods diſpencing with the Law? where the ſpecial reſervation of <hi>Paul?</hi> he did it not againſt the humanity of Chriſt but his Divinity; it was for calling on his Name.</p>
                     <p>Some excuſe <hi>Paul</hi> becauſe zealous; but others anſwer, ſo may any other be eſteemed; who ſhall venture the judgement of the Magiſtrate for blaſphemy? ſurely there is no word to warrant death for blaſphemy, no not of one who hath profeſſed Chriſtianity, but the old ſo called Law.</p>
                     <p>But moſt aſſuredly, the Magiſtrate hath a great latitude, and may to ſome evidently and notorious inordinate liver inflict death.</p>
                     <p>Whereas he who onely from conſulting over-curiouſly the God-head by reaſon, and not comprehending the Eſſence of the infinite verity and wiſdom by his works, ſhall doubt, and ſo deny God his Power, &amp;c. ought not nor can juſtly be puniſhed with death by the Magiſtrate: but for ſuch the Congregations ought to pray and endeavor; and if yet he cannot be convinced, living civilly and humbly, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ought to wait with patience, uſing all due means, if ſo be it may be, that at laſt the Lord will reveal this thing unto him.</p>
                     <p>The ſame in a manner is to be the rule of Idolatry; for as the moſt horrid blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer will allow, if there were a God (for he is an Atheiſt) he would not blaſpheme; ſo the Idolater, if this were Idolatry, he would not Idolize, and ſo not tempt to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry. For Witches there is much leſs doubt; for moſt of them are drawn by malice to renounce God (whom then they muſt own) and dammage men, either of which muſt end in death for death.</p>
                     <p>For Murderers, Buggerers, Burglars, and the like, are without queſtion as capable to us of repentance as any of theſe, and then no one with Chriſtians ſhould dye for any offence.</p>
                     <p>And it is plain, as before, that in the Apoſtolicall Writings there is held forth nothing of the legal puniſhments; <hi>Paul</hi> and all of the Apoſtles writing and bending their ſpeeches to the Churches, who were faithfull, elected to be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:105181:88"/> Saints; and for the Sinners they were to reprehend and convince, exhort, and perſwade, and for greatneſs of crime or obſtinacy to caſt out; And <hi>Paul</hi> for all other things leaves them to the Magiſterial Power.</p>
                     <p>By which I preſume it is plain, that offending againſt the verity and purity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, the Church ought to eject; and offending againſt the purity of Righteouſneſs under Evangelical englightenments, the Magiſtrate ought to puniſh, according to the Nature of the offence; that the Magiſtrate was to follow the Churches cenſure as unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to judge of ſuch crimes, is not to be moved; or that the Church could not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle until the legal Tryal were ratified, is as contrary to ſound Truth: Now if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate may judge, he may enact Laws as it is plain; from whence I conclude, That the Civil Magiſtrate hath the power of Right to eſtabliſh Laws againſt irreligion, <hi>viz.</hi> blaſphemy, Idolatry, and tempting to Idolatry, and that in ſome caſes with death.</p>
                     <p>In Witchcraft without doubt, unleſs you ſhall diſtinguiſh in Witchcraft, as in the other between the witch that hath covenanted with the Divel, nouriſheth Imps, &amp;c. and does no harm to man in body or goods, and they that do, as in caſe of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie or blaſphemous opinions, private and publiſhed, Idolators and inticers to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, leaving the mental and opinionative part to God, and the Active ſenſible part to man.</p>
                     <p>But ſurely this reaſon ſhould as to Blaſphemy, Idolatry, and Witchcraft, have been as well conſidered under the Law; for the Reaſon ſeems to be the ſame.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed, under the name of witches I comprehend Enchanters, Poyſoners, keepers of familiar ſpirits, and all that have entred any actual Covenant with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, be it by word or writing.</p>
                     <p>Now that which evidences to me moſt ſtrongly the power of the Civil Magiſtrate, in and concerning theſe matters, is, that they are called works of the fleſh; which to the judicious Inquiſitive, will plainly denote the light of Nature might evince them of the contrary; for they are deviations from the pure light of reaſon, to blaſpheme a God, to worſhip or allure to the worſhip of a ſtock, or ſtone, or Image for a God, or to make a league with the Divel.</p>
                     <p>But if you ask whether I intend this Doctrine univerſally as laid down; I cannot agree it.</p>
                     <p>For firſt to Heathens I allow it not, as abhorring the inference of propagating Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by the Sword.</p>
                     <p>Next I allow it not to ſober civil doubting men; for abſolutely prophane and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſcoffers I yet beleeve, and cannot ſee to the contrary but that their blood is upon their own heads; As in caſe of Murder, breaking open of houſes, &amp;c. and what elſe the Law doth puniſh mortally; this gives much more liberty to men then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore: But what if as <hi>Paul</hi> preached <hi>Diana</hi> &amp;c. to be no gods but the work of mens hands; That a Turk ſhould preach publickly the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt to be a meer fancy, and blaſphemy; In this caſe as a Turk let him be forbidden; if not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let him be baniſhed.</p>
                     <p>How can a Chriſtian Magiſtrate to witneſs his zeal to his God, and his endeavour to eſtabliſh the peace of his Countrey, do leſs?</p>
                     <p>But if he be a Chriſtian that thus Apoſtatizes, the rule is limited before.</p>
                     <p>But the beſt way is, where there is juſt doubt, the Chriſtian Magiſtrate is not to go to the height and rigor of life, but to ſeek out with all wiſdom, a due remedy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the light of our Goſpel-profeſſion, and not ceaſe till a rule were ſet.</p>
                     <p>All the other power of the Magiſtrate for the well living of men, might eaſily be included in Laws concerning Magiſtrates ſuperior and inferior, and people, and thoſe either living in Cities or Towns, or private families, whether of parents and children, Tutor and Pupils, husbands and wives, maſters and ſervants, for all contracts, houſes and lands, bargaining and ſelling, &amp;c. words and deeds, man and beaſt, night and day, as in warding and watching, peace and warrs, as the ordering, charging, trayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and paying of Souldiers, as alſo puniſhing of them, health and ſickneſs, providing for the poor.</p>
                     <p>But ſome Judicials which are alterable, may I ſuppoſe now ſeem neceſſary, which former Ages diſallowed: As for example:</p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:105181:89"/>
                     <p>The Battelling of houſes, leſt any ſhould fall from the roof, ſo the double portion of the elder Brother.</p>
                     <p>And ſome juſt and rational Law inſtead of the ſo called Clergy, for a ſafety for ſuch offendors as it ſhall be thought meet to allow it to.</p>
                     <p>But a City is dangerous, leſt a multitude of evil perſons might prove obnoxious, except the ſtrict Rule of its Government in the ſetled inhabitants, may bridle the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancie of ſuch evil Gueſts; the Law concerning a woman with child, whereby her fruit departs from her, and thoſe who procure Abortion, by open force or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate violence.</p>
                     <p>Now although it is plain, that all Errors of Chriſtians ought to be reproved with much care, and with all Chriſtian information; yet theſe ſins which are ſo plain, are to be plainly enforced by the Civil Magiſtrate; but thoſe others which are tending to the ſervice (not diſhonour and blaſphemy) of the Almighty, ought to be with much Chriſtian perſwaſion reformed, not by power enforced; for though I muſt agree, the Magiſtrate may enforce an Atheiſt, and ſo a Non-Conformiſt for fear of puniſhment to the Congregation; and he may be there converted, for ſome undoubtedly have been;</p>
                     <p>Yet we cannot thence infer, that the work is of duty; he uſes indeed a means which reaſon is capable of, but to enforce by pecuniary puniſhments, much more corporal, is moſt aſſuredly ſo far doubted, that it is not ſuddenly to be acted; for what is for you to day, is againſt you to morrow, as the Supream Magiſtrate varies in opinion, which Law is then without its certain Rule; and that for which the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate can give no certain Rule, is not to be made by him a Rule or Law at any time.</p>
                     <p>For the Magiſtrates making Laws in theſe things which tend circumſtantially to the ſervice of the Lord with Chriſtians; I intend the matters ſo called of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, ſurely therein is the Liberty of Chriſtianity, and the glory of it, is, not to be tyed to the Apiſh formalities of Superſtition; conformity and uniformity have been made the great wheels of Satans Chariot, to hurry us from the ſimplicity of unity, Chriſtian Charity and Faith, and is to be exploded the Congregation of the Faithfull.</p>
                     <p>Now to clear the Magiſtrates power as to his Truſt in, and concerning both Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the matter is plain; the Offices of Magiſtrate and Miniſter are diſtinct; as a Magiſtrate, he cannot intermeddle with the Miniſterial proper Duties, but with the Miniſter he may, if he neglect his duty; and that is no more then that the Miniſter by his Office is not freed from Civil Judicature; And ſo, though with <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> he cannot Miniſterially diſpence the Ordinances; yet he may and ought to ſee the Miniſter do his duty; this is according to the Law of God, and of this he may be judge;</p>
                     <p>That is, he may conſult, and puniſh, and ſo inforce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (and both theſe Offices may be in one perſon.) I ſhall not enlarge concerning this any further, but now proceed in the orderly ſetling of the Commonwealth by due and neceſſary Adminiſtration of Laws for Civil peace.</p>
                     <p>But before I come to particulars, I muſt a little generally enlarge my ſelf concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power of the Magiſtrate, and his duty, that is, that the Magiſtrate hath all power, and is to execute all power in all things of what nature ſoever, conducing to the ſafety of the Commonwealth; and therefore that in ſome caſes conſcience cannot be pleaded, but notwithſtanding all ſuch pleas, due puniſhment ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</p>
                     <p>To give Examples of Murther, and Adultery, Inceſt, and the like, will be plain.</p>
                     <p>But for Concubinage, and the true Polygamy, or many wives at once will be difficult with many men.</p>
                     <p>Yet theſe ſure, if made general, being but the reſtraining of the natural appetite, and moſt conſonant to the hinted Doctrine of our Saviour in thoſe words, It was for hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart onely that <hi>Moſes</hi> allowed it, it was not ſo from the beginning, God created them male and female: The Magiſtrate may juſtly and lawfully improve his juſt Authority; but to extend it to death, as hath been uſed, was aſſuredly not ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly warrantable.</p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:105181:89"/>
                     <p>But to embroyl a Nation in War and blood, or lay a foundation to it for not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in the manner of exerciſing the Ordinances of the Goſpel, that cannot be allowed.</p>
                     <p>Such as marrying with a Ring; at the Table with a Communion, to receive it ſitting or kneeling, to adminiſter it in the morning or at night, with a Surplice or white gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with all the like, that it muſt be done onely in the publike Place of publike Worſhip, ſo called Church; and this to prevent Hereſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Surely it is natural to each man to believe his own opinion right, and that he is edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in, the natural man without further controverſie allows; however he practiſes clean contrary.</p>
                     <p>Now it is certain, being all born in ſin, and under wrath, there muſt be a work of God upon the Spirit before we underſtand the things of God; this God doth ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily by Preaching, Reading, Praying, Conferring, Meditating; ſometimes by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions with theſe; ſometimes by an extraordinary accident, as delivery from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected danger, or ſeeing ſome great judgement, or ſudden plague in and upon other men; a thouſand wayes there are whereby God preaches to a man.</p>
                     <p>Now accordingly as the Spirit is affected, ſo uſually is the man zealous or remiſs; and aſſuredly in ſuch changes God is ſeen and glorified moſt, as are from very bad to very good, as <hi>Paul</hi> from a Perſecutor to become u Preacher; and here the world takes moſt offence.</p>
                     <p>It is true, the Angel of the Church is not to ſuffer the woman <hi>Jezabel,</hi> nor the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> to take root in the Church of God, but to labour with the Sword of the Spirit (not with fire and faggot) to reprove, exhort, admoniſh, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, convince; and the Magiſtrates ought to exhort the Congregations to their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that men ſo qualified be ordained Elders in all the Churches, and that they do dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and faithfully improve the gifts given them, to the edification and peace of the the Church, and the gifts ceaſing, to ſee others appointed in their places.</p>
                     <p>And the Paſtors are to ſee the diſobedient, and perverſly refractory to be ejected their Societies.</p>
                     <p>And the Magiſtrate may approve the Rule of the Congregation, that no other Congregation receive them ejected, without ſatisfaction to them who ejected, firſt given.</p>
                     <p>So that if you take the exhortative, inforcing the juſt duty of Chriſtians, from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the Chriſtian Magiſtrate to be the keeper of the firſt Table, he may be ſo called.</p>
                     <p>But if you take it for the perſon properly choſen by God, to maintain, aſſert, and defend the truth of his Service; the Magiſtrate hath a ſhare in it as a Chriſtian, if he be ſuch, and the Paſtors the like; a ſpecial ſhare, in regard of their more immediate truſts; but this keeping of the firſt Table, is a Right belonging in my opinion to the whole body of Chriſtians, and every member may claim his due.</p>
                     <p>The Magiſtrates, even while pretending to it, have been the greateſt oppugners of it; witneſs the perſecuting Chriſtian ſo called, Kings and Princes in the Church, the ſo called Clergy drawing in the ſame cord; witneſs the cruel Maſſacres and Perſecutions the Pope and Biſhops have raiſed for the ſame pretences; and all we believe againſt the Truth; ſo that it is manifeſt theſe did not keep it; who then kept it?</p>
                     <p>But they who had no Magiſtrate among them, and ſeldome a Miniſter ſo called to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them; yet were the rite of Gods Service kept by them as by the ſeven thouſand in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when King, Biſhop, Prieſt, and all worſhipped <hi>Baal.</hi> I now haſten to the Settlement intended; wherein I ſhall begin with Education of children.</p>

                     <head>How Children are to be Educated by Magiſtrates Authority.</head>
                     <p>THe Lord God took care for the meat or nutriment of ſpecial children, even in the Womb;</p>
                     <p>But ordered every Mother to give her own child ſuck, preſuppoſing that riches and honor were but ſubſervient to Natures ends; but this ſtrictneſs now accounted, though the Magiſtrate might exact it where it could be, or puniſh its neglect,</p>
                     <p>Yet aſſuredly to inforce it in this our Age, were to debilitate and enervate the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for our rich people are generally ſo luxurious, that if the weakneſs of the decaied ſtifled generative vertue choaked with exceſs, were not opened again to operate more acutely through another kind of nutriment in the poor Nurſe, they would all prove Changlings to old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Valour, though in ſuch a ſoul the ſplendors of Chriſtianity may be as excellent, as in the ſtrongeſt, faireſt and healthieſt conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>This I hint onely to intimate, at leaſt to Profeſſors, what a duty is upon them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs theſe exceſſes, which are ſo ruinous to Nature, and ought to be puniſhed; Natural men have out-gone moſt Modern Chriſtians in theſe vertues.</p>
                     <p>My aim is at the manner, not ſo much of educating babes, or ſo called children, as youth; that is, from ſeven years to eighteeen at leaſt, if not one and twenty, or better five and twenty.</p>
                     <p>Now to this end, I ſuppoſe, that it is the duty of the Magiſtrate to Erect and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize, at leaſt, in the head-Town of every County Schools of Vertue, that is, fitted with Maſters to teach and inſtruct the youth, according to their Ages and Capacities, in Arts and Arms; I mean by Arts, Trades of all ſorts and learning of all ſorts, atcord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Rule; This provided, that it is not intended, that all children ſhould contiue meerly learners till five and twenty; and it is ſuppoſed that the preſent values, rents, and profits, of, and belonging to Inns of Court and Chancery, Univerſities, and Schools, will ſerve for this work; however ſo far that the defect may eaſily be ſupplied.</p>
                     <p>But that they ſhould not be accounted men till that age, nor to manage their own affairs, much leſs of the Commonwealth, but be under Guardianſhip.</p>
                     <p>And by Arms, I mean all the exerciſes of the body, whereby ſtrength and agility ſhall be increaſed, courage raiſed, and yet being under a Tutor obedience nouriſhed, and Prudence eſtabliſhed; for theſe Academies or Schools, it is requiſite to have their Rules grave and ſtrict, but not ridiculous, not ſuch as flat Caps after ſo long diſuſed, nor Cappings of ſo called Fellows as was in Colledges though the rain pour down, but to order ſuch due reſpect as breeds an aw with love, wherein there muſt be neceſſary ſeverity, not rigid peeviſh Tyranny; the aw muſt expreſs it ſelf in a due ſilence, as well as active diligence; for the expence of ſpirits is great in clamorous, nay talkative youth; and ſure, would quick and ripe wits not vent ſo faſt, their ſtore would laſt longer; this makes many pregnant young men to be old dotards.</p>
                     <p>Let theſe have diſcreet Viſitors, or Superintendents, who once every moneth ſhall come and view the progreſſes of the ſeveral years, and a penalty ſet, and that ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; this due training of youth will enable them to rule in ſeaſon; the want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing due obedience in Education renders moſt men unfit to govern; by this means the natural abilities of all men will be tried, and the vertuous eyed as fit for high imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the care of Parents will be quieted, while their children are ſo nigh, as once in a week they may eaſily hear of their health and ſickneſs; and the nighneſs to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents will aw the child from ſuch extravagancies as youth is ſubject to at all times, but moſt when they are far from them, whom Nature teaches to fear by degrees.</p>
                     <p>The habits of theſe Students I inforce not that they be all alike, but that none be trimmed with Velvet, Lace, Points, Ribonds, or ſuch fooleries; none to wear long Hair, Rings, Scarfes, Fringes, Roſes, Weapon or Boots; and that due and civil reſpects be obſerved among themſelves, according to their degrees; but no fancies of Cuſtom to be allowed, as Salting, Muſtarding, or any ſuch lightneſſes, nor any trials of Wit or Strength, but in the preſence of a Maſter.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſhall both poor and rich be fitted to the ſervice of the Commonwealth, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will be baniſhed, and ignorance deſpiſed; for all that were capable ſhould to theſe Schools for a time, till diſmiſſed to Trades, for neceſſary living by the Viſitors or Superintendents; for prayers among them early and late, it is neceſſary; but let
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:105181:90"/> the hours be apportioned for Study and Exerciſe, and let each day be Catachiſtical to the knowledge of Chriſtian Doctrine, as Moral or Civil converſation.</p>
                     <p>But you muſt admit no Colledge-School, or Academy, to have any Priviledges of ſeparate Juriſdiction, as now or formerly, they are but the inciters to Debauchery and Riot, with great emulation and diſturbance of the Peace; The Magiſtrate muſt command; Let no door be free from the knock of the Conſuls Ax, it will make ſome heady one or other at ſome time or other to lay the foundations of chuſing Tribunes of the people.</p>
                     <p>Let onely their obedience to the Law be their priviledge and ſecurity; onely let the Tutors be free from perſonal ſervice in War, or other ſervice in Peace; but for payments, let them be charged upon him according to his Rate.</p>
                     <p>Let the books of Learning be publikely appointed by the Magiſtrate, not at the Tutors will; let not all be inforced to Latin, but each to Read and Write in ſome meaſure; Let times of riſing be ſet down, and alſo going to bed, and ſome certain times wherein the children may recreate, but by parcels not all at once, which now is caſe of great confuſion rudeneſs and diſturbance.</p>
                     <p>Let the Maſters interchangeably have times of reſpit for extraordinary occaſions; This will ſpeedily give a large increaſe for knowledge, which will make that your Magiſtrates in all places may be men of knowledge, which will embelliſh the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; whereas now moſt Cities, Towns, yea I may ſay Counties are deſpiſed in Government for default of prudent knowing men: A long Robe-man or two guide all, and in this Age of intereſt, and theſe mens intereſts ſo viſible as aforeſaid, all is let run to confuſion.</p>
                     <p>And by this will alſo the ſeveral Congregations be fitted with able knowing Paſtors, and Teachers; yea honeſt vertuous emulation in ingenuous ſpirits, will render almoſt every Member a Doctor.</p>
                     <p>This is ſeemingly a matter of great charge; therefore before I proceed, I will ſee how charges are to be born, raiſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the relief of Commonwealths in exceſſive burthens of people.</p>

                     <head>How all the Charges of the Commonwealth, Fees, and Fines, &amp;c. are to be Aſſeſſed and raiſed, and by what Rule.</head>
                     <head>And the wayes to eaſe Nations when grown over-numerous.</head>
                     <p>I Know that many will ſay this is good in Speculation, but the Practiſe is difficult, yea ſome will ſay impoſſible; for you cannot get all men of one mind to it; others that it is againſt Priviledge to inforce children from the Parents Tuition, who being Guardians by Nature, the Law will not, may not, admit any Rule to bar his Right?</p>
                     <p>Others, This is a matter requiring great and vaſt expence, and how ſhall it be raiſed.</p>
                     <p>To the firſt I anſwer; If the Magiſtrate hath power to make the Law, then duty ought to ſubject all minds to unity in obedience.</p>
                     <p>To the ſecond I anſwer, That this is ſo far from diſpriviledging, that it is the higheſt, yea the top ſtone of Liberty; I dare not ſay it is not poſſible to abuſe or miſuſe this power; but if rightly uſed, it is the extent of Priviledge; for may a Magiſtrate make a Law to keep mad mens children, to educate Ideots, Lunaticks, and the like, and diſpoſe their goods, to the neceſſary uſe of their Family, which all Laws of Nature and Nations allow?</p>
                     <p>Who art thou then Quaerieſt? if thou doſt it thy ſelf, thou wilt grant that muſt be by allowed means and lawful wayes.</p>
                     <p>I ſay not That there cannot be juſt cauſes of Negation, but I ſay Submit to juſt things in their Seaſons, it is your duty; and deny unjuſt ones when time of trial comes, that is your duty alſo. This takes not away your Guardianſhip of Nature, but makes your load lighter, eſpecially when and where it is greateſt; for the moſt poor and ignorant are moſt like to brable and wrangle ſuch intendments; for the charge, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs its great; but the great Lett will be, if you ſettle this aright, the rich muſt pay for the education of the poor, and the barren of them that have children.</p>
                     <p>For I can allow nothing of a Rate but by an equal pound Rate, and that on all the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105181:91"/> eſtates of all perſons, and that not onely for Wars but for the poor; for maintenance of Miniſters, yea for Bridges, Cauſywayes, Highwayes, all publike Meeting-places, and that both for Divine and Civil affairs; if you ſettle it no higher then Counties at firſt, it may do ſomething; but in a young or begun State, it is requiſite to caſt all into a lump; were Righteouſneſs obvious in the diſpoſers, it would eaſily be aſſented to.</p>
                     <p>But now the fear is, and Objections are, if you do thus, the Parliament men will look to diſtribution of parts moſt unequally; and they that are beſt friended ſhall have the beſt proportion, though they have leaſt need.</p>
                     <p>As now in general Leavies, The Towns and Counties are moſt free or burthened, as they have active Parliament men, Committee men and Juſtices of the Peace to ſtand by them.</p>
                     <p>Therefore firſt it is requiſite that each man ſhew forth integrity in his actions, caſt away ſelfiſhneſs; own in deeds what you profeſs; be not deceived, God cannot be mocked; The Heathens at the preaching of Jeſus, yea the Wiſe men, they that uſed curious Arts, brought their Books of great price and burnt them; come and do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with your advantageous intereſts of all ſorts; you are all a Nation without ſcruple, though no National Church. But you object further:</p>
                     <p>This Nation hath loſt its Politike Rule, it is overſpread with multitudes of men, nay multitudes of poor; ſo that to take care for the educating of all theſe, is, you ſay, wholly unfeazable.</p>
                     <p>To this I ſay, That no Nation, if not plagued with War or Diſeaſes, but naturally it will grow over-numerous.</p>
                     <p>Now the Magiſtrate Supream ought truly to know the contents of his Territory, and be as able to lay out the poſſible ſubſiſtance of his Subjects, as the wiſe Graſier, to know how many beaſts will be depaſtured in ſuch a ground, or how much ſeed will ſow one Acre.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the Myſteries of wiſe Regiments, which few Princes or Magiſtrates now adayes, if at any time will ſtudy, but it is their duty; for from not well conſidering theſe things, Nations which might in ordinary courſe live quiet, being grown over populous, whereby the due care of inferior Magiſtrates is obſtructed, they grow looſe and lazy, then ſwarve into crimes;</p>
                     <p>Then complain of neglects of duty of Magiſtrates which is evident; then intereſt gains head, theſe make parties, and then the Sate is either embroiled or altered.</p>
                     <p>Therefore if the Princes will in the uſe of the wiſdom God hath given them to Rule by, Rule well and ſafely, they muſt once every ſeven years number their people; if the Accidents, I muſt ſo call them, of Plague, War, Famine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath not done it; and either by opening a fit way publikely known of eaſing their Counties burthen, by ſetling them in an other County; or if all Counties be full, by tranſporting them into an other Country avoid this danger.</p>
                     <p>This Act of Numeration well uſed, will take off the jealouſie to what end ſuch matters tend, and the well and carefully providing for the Colonies will encourage Adventurers; This will enlarge a Nation infinitely; and if well carried on, will by juſt means ſo ſettle Chriſtian intereſt, that great, if not univerſal, will be the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Now we ſend away Rogues; then you may ſend away Preachers, Teachers, Scholars, Maſters of Prudence, in reſpect of Chriſtian and Civil know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                     <p>This fitted, you ſee viſibly your charge cannot be ſo inſupportable; you look at the Commonwealths corruptions, as now wholly ſick, wholly defiled, this frights you; but let your ſpeculations mount higher; it is not <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topianiſme,</hi> it is Chriſtian wiſe order; all you that look for Chriſts Raign upon earth, labor after it.</p>
                     <p>I bid you not ſit down by this, this is rational, yours is divine, this may be, it hath been, yours may and is to be prayed and attended for patiently; and if it heightens you in the active part of more exemplary converſation, who will oppoſe it, let him firſt live above you, and then teach you, not upbraid your opinion.</p>
                     <p>But ſurely all the Taxes, Charges, Levies, Payments ought all to be ſet, aſſeſſed, and paid according to one ſet Rate; ſo that each poor honeſt Countrey man may imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reſolve his payment, and in caſe of Refuſal, the Officer may know how to leavy it, namely by diſtreſs; and all to have one time, and till that time be paſt, the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:105181:91"/> Magiſtrate ought not to iſſue out his Warrant, and then upon a Warrant the Magiſtrate ſuperior to be ſued, not the Officer for levying it; for no reaſon he ſhould be queſtioned or moleſted (much leſs undone as now) for executing the commands of his Superior; for it is agreed the inferiour Officer in legal Adminiſtration ought, and ſo may act, not queſtion; otherwiſe each Officer might delay; and therefore it is juſtly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, if he denyes and takes upon himſelf the knowledge of the Law; if he miſtakes he is highly finable; and his Fine, and all other Fines, and the Fees, and Salaries belonging to all publick Officers, ought to be ſo Aſſeſſed and leavied, &amp;c. And where no diſtreſs is apparent, that is, no goods in the houſe, be they whoſe they will, or denyal, and they either delay or by denyal, impriſonment till payment, if able to pay.</p>
                     <p>I muſt in this caſe alſo remember, That it is fit that no perſon as no place be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſed from payments; for if one may be, all may be, except onely as neceſſity enforces, and then to endure no longer then the time: Kings and Officers have made great advantage of theſe unjuſtices, to the inſupportable dammage of the Nation, and ought ſpeedily to be rectified; and all Grants, Charters, Uſages, and Cuſtomes to that end to be void.</p>
                     <p>So have ſome Lords of Mannors, holding originally of the Crown, as it is called, as of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> got ſuch priviledges as they are called, which ought not to be, nor may by juſt Law; for that ſuch priviledges are diſpriviledges to the whole Community, opening a door to injuſtice and irregularity, and conſequently to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; for all may be freed from charges, taxes, ſervices, and the like, as well as one; And to ſay it is to be preſumed the Supream Magiſtrate will not do it, is vain; they have abuſed themſelves, and many ſubjects much, who have paid largely forſuch grants; and after the Princes have been forced to plead they were miſtaken in their Grants, and the poor men have been left remedileſs, for their purchaſe money.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place it is fit that all viſible perſonal eſtates be rated as they appear; and people viſibly rich in Apparel, Houſe, Houſhold-ſtuff, Dyet, &amp;c. be eſteemed as they eſteem themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Now the end of all Fines ought to be the defraying of the publick Charges of the Nation, City, or County, and the Offices there reſpectively; and to make theſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by compoſition, muſt be as experience hath manifeſted the inlet to greater corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and abuſes; and though other Ages having ſeen the evils of the old way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition-evil, deſerted that, and therefore gave Fees at large, preſuming they would take their ſalary, and fees beſides; yet it is manifeſt it was the evil of bad men; for the other is the beſt Law; and puniſh ſtrictly, and fear not, you ſhall have Juſtice exact.</p>

                     <head>The Magiſtrates Power and Duty as to ordering of Families.</head>
                     <p>THis Power hath divers objects, as between the Husband and Wife, Parent and Childe, Maſter and Servant, and ſo contrarily, and alſo the Maſter of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and Strangers.</p>
                     <p>It is very requiſite to be very wary in the head Law; the Lord God only gave the power to the husband generally; Now the exerciſe of that power in the Jewiſh ſtate was Tyrannical and abſolute, and ended generally in divorce; and what needed any inferiour Law where the head Law was ſo Magiſterial?</p>
                     <p>But this being either obſolete in it ſelf, or made ſo, or both (and really the Lord Chriſts words intimate no ſeparation, except only for Adultery; and that expoſition is the foundation to many as they ſuppoſe juſtly not to make Adultery death; for if ſo, what needed divorce, but this is omitted here) and we proceed.</p>
                     <p>Let us ſee what is the Law of the Goſpel; truly it teacheth a duty and obedience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what the rudiments of the world enable unto: Our Common Law ſeems to me in ſomething too divine as I may ſay; As for example, it will not admit what we evidently ſee (<hi>viz.</hi>) that a man cannot rule his wife; there are women which will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Law againſt the will of the Husband; and indeed it is viſibly not in his power to help; they will not only ſell and give his goods, but break, ſpoyle, miſ-ſpend, &amp;c. They will ſome beat the Husband, ſome cruelly miſ-uſe the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:105181:92"/> children, &amp;c. and no way to puniſh them, but the good man is anſwerable for all.</p>
                     <p>I know the wretchedneſs of many men, but there is a little weak Law againſt them; Let us alſo have ſome Law publick for the women with that tenderneſs is fitting to conjugal Societies; but there muſt be an aw in ſome one or more Magiſtrates, even to bridle ſuch exorbitances and neglects on either ſide, and make due a proviſion in all caſes, and that wiſely and ſpeedily; or Divorces (indeed as uſual) will be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, and from thence Fornications and Adulteries clandeſtine and private, make what Laws you can, though a legal divorce may be waved.</p>
                     <p>Next as to children, there is no due aw and reſpect of or in ſome, nay many Parents; the duty of the ſenſe of education is wholly loſt; there is nothing but rude and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant looſneſs; not only Parents curſe Children, or provide not duly for them; but Children the Parents; and for want of a head Rule, no queſtion is made more of this then violences in any other relations.</p>
                     <p>Now in caſe of ſuch Rule, it is fit to proceed by a more particular Law; for if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right knowing zealous Judges be not, there is no right; therefore it is fit to make theſe Laws Oeconomical more particular then others.</p>
                     <p>Again, as to Parents neglecting the due proviſion for their family, the Magiſtrate is wholly beaten out of it; The rule ought to be, that the Magiſtrate might take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance, what a man can earn if imployed; next that he and his be ſet on work; and thirdly, that he doth not, nor ſhall miſpend it, but that the houſe-rent and all be carefully diſcharged; and then where labour fayles, to be ſupplyed by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Purſe.</p>
                     <p>Next for ſervants, not each one that will to entertain ſervants, unleſs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly able to maintaine and imploy them; for otherwiſe there will be many ſluts and more Thieves, with multitudes of Receivers, which the Law can take no notice of.</p>
                     <p>This Law muſt extend to all ſorts of ſervants which have not eſtates to maintain themſelves viſibly; otherwiſe there will be from the neglect in one, a viſible careleſneſs towards all.</p>
                     <p>Let no ſervant under a penalty be hired, but with a publike inrolment in the Town or Precinct Pariſhional, or otherwayes; however neither diſmiſſed, or to go into another Precinct without Licenſe of an Officer in Writing; this is the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at preſent; onely careleſneſs of Magiſtrates admitted pride to grow too faſt in ſervants, and then all was omitted, and this is a main inlet to Confuſion.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo fit ſtrictly, by a ſworn Officer, to keep the Records of the Birth of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for the Age is now groſly miſtaken, and no aſcertained way of probation, with a ſmall fee, as a groat to the State to pay the Officer for enrolment, ſo much for ſearch, ſo much a Certificate.</p>
                     <p>For that of Strangers, it is to ſettle a little better the power, not only of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Family in general, but particularly of thoſe who either by profeſſion, are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, or others like them, upon other accidental occaſions, who now are by ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons made ſervants to their Luſts, and have no power to bridle exorbitancy that they can know; for to ſpeak once for all, it is not enough ſome wiſe learned book-man knows all theſe Laws, or if all the ſo called Lawyers did; the Chriſtian Law muſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perſpicuouſly hold forth to every man his certain known and aſſured duty and power in their reſpective places; or the guilt, be it blood or otherwiſe, I fear lies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, if not wholly, at the Supream Magiſtrates door.</p>

                     <head>VVhether the Magiſtrate may appoint the Ages of Marriage?</head>
                     <head>And to whom the work of the Marriage belongs properly?</head>
                     <p>THe Government of the Family being ſetled, let us ſee how they part out of the Family; and that is commonly by Marriage; It is agreed, the parents did at their own Liberties diſpoſe their children; by natural reaſon (corrupted I conceive) they againſt Nature expoſed their children, not onely to the next hand of man that took it up by a ſetled place for that purpoſe, where they that had not the bleſſing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of their own bodies, might take them off others hand that had many, which hath reaſon in it, and undenyable; but their expoſings were to meer fortune, as they called it, that is, let the will of the Gods be done, let the Beaſts devour it, hunger or cold or both ſtarve it, or the merciful hand ſuſtain it and nouriſh it; but theſe are wholly rejected with us; the way is to ſuſtain them till fit for labour or Marriage.</p>
                     <p>Now that of labor is generally hinted before, none may be brought up idle.</p>
                     <p>Now for Marriage, there is much to be ſaid; The general plea is, the Magiſtrate hath no power to ſet an age for Marriage; The reaſon is generally, that there are divers times wherein Nature works with men and women; and to preſcribe one certain rule for all, is unfit.</p>
                     <p>Next, it is the Parents duty to take care of that.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the gift of Continencie is of God, and not of man; and the Magiſtrate hath no power; the firſt and laſt I ſhall couple together, and anſwer them thus.</p>
                     <p>It is truth, divers men and women are of divers tempers and Conſtitutions, and therefore one time will not agree to all; but ſurely the matter is not whether all men or women ſhall marry at one age, but that there is a duty upon the Magiſtrate to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the vigour of the Nation by ſeaſonable Marriages; doth it not much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us to breed a generation of men fit to manage beaſts, then to breed beaſts fit for management?</p>
                     <p>This natural ſimilar reaſon is of ſome force; ſurely there is too much looſeneſs in this our Law, to allow Copulation at twelve in the woman, and fourteen in the man.</p>
                     <p>Now the diſquiſition of the other part concerning the gift of Continency will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the whole; for I pray you how is the Law of Liberty and Continency to be pleaded? may the Child marry without the good liking of the Parent? Can the Child plead to him that he hath not the gift of Continencie? or do we rather know it is the looſneſse of Government, the evil of idle unclean education both in young men and Maids, that inflames affections? The young ones are ignorant of what is ſin, and the eldeſt often, and they fall into contagious offences each with other, before they underſtand the rules of wiſe Reaſon, being led away of natural appetite; and not withſtanding all incentives, the father is allowed to diſſent from the Marriage of his ſon or daughter; and in caſe of diſobedience, to chaſtiſe with ſtroaks or diſinheriſon, or both, the ſon; and it is done to the daughter; But ſhould the ſon that had ſtoln the daughter bring an Action, or the married ſon, could he juſtifie, or not, by the Law?</p>
                     <p>I profeſs the caſe is difficult; for if lawful, why beaten? if not lawful, why may not the Magiſtrate ſet the rule of reſtraint to Naturall appetite as well as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent? the publick as the private Magiſtrate? for by paternal power and Juriſdiction he enforces.</p>
                     <p>Now the Chriſtian Magiſtrate therefore upon the whole may and ought to bridle this beaſt in man by a diſcreet Moderate Law, to reſtrain the Luſts of proud, rich, lazy, idle, and ſo luſtfull young ones;</p>
                     <p>And take of the itch of mean ones, by work, and labor of the body and minde, or both, with ſlender dyet, and holy exerciſes, Divine and Spiritual breathings after
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:105181:93"/> God, in the ſenſe of our own weakneſs, will as well reſtrain exorbitant affections in Chriſtians, as the love of Philoſophy, or the fear of the gods, ſo called, could Heathens; Let us not therefore eat to luſt and live in idleneſs, and then we muſt marry, O we burn.</p>
                     <p>It is as lawful from that reaſon to have many wives, many husbands, or diverſity of men, or women, in the accidents of ſickneſs, long journeys, and the like of yoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellows.</p>
                     <p>The Modern Age is wholly looſe, through pretence of Chriſtian Liberty; that is the undoing deſtructive principle; and it ſeems by many who out of zeal againſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wandrings, go about to eclipſe the glimpſes of divine inlightenments, to be fit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to be rejected; but both muſt ſtand: a juſt Liberty with a due reſtraint, that Juſtice with Righteouſneſs be in all.</p>
                     <p>Now as it is rational, that the publick Magiſtrate may temper the liberty of the child, not to marry till a ſeaſon; ſo after that ſeaſon to mitigate the Rigidity of the parent is as neceſſary, many parents being extream and cruel, forcing them to marry whom and how they pleaſe, or not admitting Marriage at all.</p>
                     <p>I know the difficulty of theſe buſineſſes hath diſcouraged, but Chriſtian piety ought to advance endeavors in this kind, yea in ſome caſes to portion moderately children dutiful and obedient in all other things, and permit them their own choyces, if nothing can be objected on the parents part but meer will.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo fit to reſolve the degrees of Marriage; for late Liberty hath made Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries concerning a juſt and Regular Law.</p>
                     <p>And to ſee all this done, the Magiſtrate is the onely fit man.</p>
                     <p>The Act is meerly civil; it is old Popery acknowledging Marriage a Sacrament, that onely continues it in the Clergie ſo called; Therefore let no Marriage be ſolemnized, but before one or more publick Magiſtrates thereto appointed, inrolled or recorded in a book of purpoſe, with their hands, and of the Parent, if living, or Certificate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hand and Seal of the Magiſtrate where the parties live; otherwiſe of the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, unleſs they be of ſuch an Age as is fixed by the Magiſtrate, or they be married by Magiſterial Authority, that is, though the Parent before refuſe, having no juſt cauſe; alwayes reſolved, that if a Magiſtrate offends, or Raſures be and alterations, that the puniſhments be exceeding high.</p>

                     <p>Now the Laws of Cities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though they muſt, in the regards aforeſaid be diverſe, yet in reſpect of their proper nature, as bodies corporate, they ought all prefixedly and poſitively to have thoſe Laws ſet and known, and a due enforcing power in a ſpeedy way; for the ſtanding out of a man in a tedious ſuit, cools all obedience, as Experience manifeſts clearly.</p>

                     <p>But a caſe will enlighten ſomewhat; Suppoſe one doth beleeve, as many are ſaid to do, the aboliſhing of the Sabboth, may the Magiſtrate enforce obedience?</p>
                     <p>To this I ſay, that he that holds the aboliſhing of the Sabboth, held a Sabboth was and then muſt acknowledge the power whereby that Sabboth was, and ſo the end to which it was directed, which was the eaſe of the creature from corporal labor, and for his edification in the ſervice of God in the Spirit; This gives no looſe to any Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundrie that day, no Sporting, no nor idle Tatling, Walkings, but the Spirits Recreations in the Contemplations of Divinity ought to be the repaſts of the Soule.</p>
                     <p>Then aſſuredly the Magiſtrate may hinder this, and cauſe keeping within doors, and puniſh offenders; Therefore let not the Gates of a City be opened that day, but to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105181:94"/> ſuch as paſs too and fro, and are known, and that to partake in divine and ſpiritual ſervices, and that not above a Sabbath dayes journey; and agree that, but dilate not twelve moneths what is a Sabboth dayes journey; but within the private Family there is no inforcing of the Magiſtrate; that is, he ſeems not to be bound to it, nor is his power evident.</p>
                     <p>No, the better way to know the care and diligence of the Maſter of the Family, is, to appoint ſome men, not as Church Officers, but Civil Inquiſitors of Knowledge, who may ſee the progreſs in Knowledge of ſuch as are out of the Schools and Colledges, and puniſh, or cauſe them to be puniſhed at firſt; and afterwards the Parents and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; and not to admit to places of Magiſtracy, ſuch as are ignorant themſelves; ſo neither thoſe that do not carefully educate and inſtruct their Family, whereby they may in their ſeaſon become ſerviceable in the Congregation of the faithful.</p>
                     <p>Now this war of Hereticks and profane perſons being over; let us ſee what is to be done to thoſe without the Church.</p>
                     <p>I ſay to theſe, That theſe alſo as the Religion wherein they were educated, are to be permitted their Conſcience without force; ſuppoſe them Papiſts, and ſuppoſe them Idolators, ſuppoſe them Turks, and ſuppoſe them Heathens; for unleſs by the pure light of Nature they muſt or may ſee it, that is, it be evident and perſpicuous; I take it, Reaſon, Divine or Humane, corrects not, notwithſtanding that Parable of the Servant that knew not his Maſters Will and was to be beaten.</p>
                     <p>Now this is evident; for among all the claſhings amongſt opinions untill now, where was it not, that every one ſtrove onely to free themſelves from the power of others to be inforced, yet would inforce others? but now I take it to be the infinite Mercy of the Lord to reveal this thing unto us that ſee it, how many do not; that is they can ſee nothing but confuſion accompany it.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the other part of Papiſtry, though claimed as part of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Pope is Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and may diſpoſe Kingdoms, diſſolve Leagues, Oathes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit obedience to powers, and that becauſe he hath ſaid it, there is no faith to be kept with Hereticks: All or any of theſe being contrary to the peace and ſafety of a State, may be enforcedly renounced, and the parties denying juſtly baniſhed; I ſay not their goods confiſcate; for we know many do conſcienciouſly hold theſe things, and with great ſtrength of Natural Reaſon, as much as maintains the greateſt pretending opinion in this Age, and now in conteſt with us; And in caſe of Reſiſtance War is lawful.</p>
                     <p>So that in brief I take it, War is lawful againſt the Enemies of the Church, Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with Spiritual weapons, againſt the carnal enemies with corporal weapons of Baniſhment in caſe of deſtructive errors to peace and civil quiet; and warlike force, where the State and Nation cannot otherwiſe in Prudence ſecure it ſelf for the entring the others Country or Limits.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, To make that the Seate of the war, where other things are clear, the Law of Nations which admit it, will well ſetle it.</p>

                     <head>How the Militia ought to be ſetled.</head>
                     <p>ALL Humane Laws have their ſettlements, and of themſelves naturally devolve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Error; ſo that if we eye all the wiſe ſettlements of Nations in this or ought elſe, it is nought worth now: The <hi>Jewiſh, Romane, Grecian, Egyptian,</hi> or other old or Modern; the foundation yet of moſt of theſe, being originally Regal and abſolute, held one courſe to engage, as our <hi>William</hi> ſo called the Conqueror did the great men to an abſolute dependance upon him, and by them to vaſſalize the reſidue.</p>
                     <p>I know many godly honeſt people ſee no ſuch thing; I believe it, God gives gifts va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly; but moſt certain it is ſuch dependancies are the Nurſes of Feuds and Jealouſies; If therefore you will ſetle the <hi>Militia</hi> aright, you muſt ſuppoſe your Nation or Juriſdiction at terms of Unity among themſelves, under no great and eminent civil broyl; for then none on the adverſe party to them in power, or juſtly ſuſpected, that is openly oppoſing (by purſe or perſon) can be for a time entruſted; but otherwiſe the power muff be in the dependance in the Supream Magiſtrate, and their active power by his general Law.</p>
                     <p>That is, That all within their Limit, from twenty ſix, or twenty eight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſixty, ſeventy, or <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be chargeable to the War; that is to ſay, They that have not eſtate to ſuch a value, to be in inferior ſervices, as Pyoners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And of this let the inferior Magiſtrate take the ordering care.</p>
                     <p>Next, All that are of ſuch an eſtate, to be charged Foot-Arms: All of ſuch an eſtate Horſe-Arms, that is, Dragoons, and Light-horſe, as the eſtate is.</p>
                     <p>Now as to this, and to all Rates, it muſt be known that there will be multitudes of Quaeries ariſing; ſome have great eſtates fit in proportion to find ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred Horſe; ſome in reſpect of great and vaſt real, others vaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal eſtates; ſome have their lands lie altogether; ſome diſperſed; ſome live in their own, ſome in Cities; ſome have great charges of children, poor friends, and decayed, ſome in debt, and ſome have granted out Annuities, Rents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and have outwardly a fair viſible eſtate, bur indeed and really ſmall.</p>
                     <p>Now in all theſe there ought to be a Rule of proportion with ſafety to the whole; for firſt, it muſt be agreed, that the Commonwealth conſiſts of real and perſonal eſtate; the real eſtate Houſe and Lands, the perſonal eſtate Goods and Money.</p>
                     <p>Now this is certain, that all Land muſt have ſtock, all Trades muſt have ſtock, it is viſible; therefore the rule of Charges of all ſorts muſt be the Land and the Stock, and that whether in City or Country.</p>
                     <p>Now for diſcharge of this, it muſt of neceſſity be either theirs whoſe viſibly it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be, or others.</p>
                     <p>For Lands, in which there is ſo much more then Turkiſh Knavery, if it were inrowled wiſely and juſtly, it would prevent much; but due puniſhment would take it all away, while impunity breeds offences, that controverſie, that gain to the Officer; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cried up ſo.</p>
                     <p>This Land, and this Stock is the ſubſiſtence of the Nation; I know Corruption fears diſcovery of eſtate; for either they are rich, and would conceal it, or poor, and fear undoing: Now to nouriſh either of theſe corrupt intereſts, is deſtructive; the laſt is moſt to be eyed, but leaſt to be regarded; for though ſome good come of it, yet it is the moſt dangerous; for from hence comes all the ſtock of Bankquerupts, and the ſudden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings of many eſteemed rich men; and indeed it is moſt unchriſtian and utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for a man knowing himſelf poor to borrow or buy at a day for what he viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and certainly ſees not he can pay, though ſuch may have thriven.</p>
                     <p>Thefore allow no diſcharge, either for rates of Aſſeſsment of Moneys or Arms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the viſible eſtate, but with certain knowledge of the owner; onely this is fit, that for Aſſeſsments for the viſible perſonal eſtate abatement be <hi>per</hi> rate as for land by the hirer (all the Objections are anſwered before as to perſonal eſtate;) and for real, let it be charged as it lies in the Counties.</p>
                     <p>I ſay not in the Towns; it is beſt leave that at the diſcretion of the Commiſſioners, or Judges for Arms, unleſs a general ſettlement by a ſtanding National Law be; only let ſuch rents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as are going out bear a proportionate charge of horſe or foot reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, as the ſaid Judges ſhall under Hand and Seal appoint and Record in their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Book.</p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:105181:95"/>
                     <p>For to ſay it once for all; all theſe Juriſdictions ought to be ſetled, and to be the Records of the County.</p>
                     <p>Now I preſume you will not find a better way for the preſent ſettlement, then the owner to be at the charge of the Horſe and Arms, the Tenant to find the keeping of it, labouring him reaſonably, ſo as alwayes to be ready for ſervice; and if he dyes not by negligence, but ſickneſs, or in Military ſervice, the owner to find another, otherwiſe the Tenant, and the Training ſervice by the Tenant alſo; for all ſervice more then for meer Trayning ſervice, ought to be the expence and publick charge of the County at leaſt, if not National, which is more juſt; then one County ſhall not bear all the burthen of war and charge alſo, as is too frequent; and for price of horſe, leſt the owner and Tenant differ, let a ſet price be ſo much for a Dragoon, ſo much a horſe of ſervice, and this price to be ſet yearly at ſuch a day.</p>
                     <p>But finding in divers places where the lands lie, will eaſe ſome part of the juſt doubt of the great mens over-powring the County by purſe and power, but nothing will avoid it wholly, except it be enacted, that no one man find above 6, 8, 10, &amp;c. hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or Arms; and that for every one that he is in proportion of eſtate chargeable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that number, let him pay ſo much yearly as ſhall be ſetled to the publick purſe, or for the eaſe of ſome particular ſervice; but better all to come to the publick purſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the County, or of the Nation.</p>
                     <p>Next, all Arms are to be owned the Nations or Publicks, yet to be in the hands of the particular perſons charged, unleſs diſpriviledged. Next, theſe Arms muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in War by fit men, and even to Chriſtians it may be ſo requiſite (if it be not ſimply unlawful) to adminiſter a Military Oath of obedience to the Officer, according to the Tenor of the Commiſſion of the Officer, or General, of faithfulneſs in his truſt; for though juſt men and vertuous are true for honeſty ſake, yet the evil will not, but the fear and conſcience of an oath will reach far with the worſt of men; And ſo to the Souldier reſpectively.</p>
                     <p>Let this, and the reaſon of the diſuſe be well Quaeried.</p>
                     <p>Some preſume the beſt way of ſettlement is to charge ſo many Arms only upon the Townſhip, whether horſe or foot, or labourers in the wayes or carriages, and all to bear their equal proportion; now this generally may be good, but the particular rule wil vary every moment; either or any of the wayes may do, ſo the Commiſſioners as they are Judges, do juſtly; for all Laws as Governments are not ſo much good or bad by Inſtitution, as by Execution; to this end it is fit as moſt think, to give a general Oath of faithfulneſs in their truſts, although they agree it true, that the generalty of men are juſt for Righteouſneſs ſake, oath or no oath, they are the ſame; And ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; but in a Commonweal, in the State that <hi>England</hi> is now in, it is fit to make Laws of this nature, probationers for a time in each County, and by due returns of what is done (which is ſo required, but neglected, for that in all things its noted only from all Acts and Ordinances, and Inſtructions earneſtly required for a day or two, and then rejected, which is a great overſight in them ſupreamly concerned; for it is viſible, all men are by this beaten out of the road of ſetled obedience, and ſpin out time to attend the iſſue; and that falling out as of old, they will never be forward to ſervice after; ſo for ſervice in Arms, the forward appear, the other ſlack; ſo in Aſſeſments upon the true value, the forward pay to the utmoſt peny, the other half, no puniſhment but talking, no, deal gently; thus is all ſenſe of obedience to Powers and Authorities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the Powers themſelves, and their ſelf-ended Agents, ſeeking to make par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for one ſuch time and perſon-ſerver ſhall in this corrupt Age have more followers then 20. honeſt men.) But I return to my task, If the ſupream Power have due returns, let them ſee and judge out of the ſeverall experiments made, what is fitteſt to be the general head Rule, and way of the charge of Arms; Its viſible in our condition at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the generality of the Nation are unfit to be entruſted; but for accidental evils there can no particular remedie be well preſcribed: the general Rule wiſely executed muſt be the top ſtone under God of the ſafety. Magazines in the ſeveral Hundreds for the publick Arms of the Hundred, or the chief Town adjoyning, or ſuch head Town, or Town of defence in a County, to be the Magazine of the County: theſe have all their objections, yea in a ſetled ſtate, all or any may be uſeful, and in a diſtracted one may prove deſtructive: now the difficulty is but to find out the beſt as we muſt ſay for the preſent temper of the Nation: for its certainly true, to ſettle unity, love and peace,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105181:96"/> and root out the jealouſies and acerbities which are riſen in a Nation; its fit to have all the ſame general Law; the Supream Magiſtrate ought ſo to adminiſter Law, that it be the ſame to all his Subjects. To follow the crochets of Machivilian Politicians by tranſplanting ſouldiers, is to nouriſh abſolute dependences, ſuch as free Common-wealths explode, &amp; only raiſe to an eminency of power to do good or evil at luſt, which is tyrannical; no; a neceſſary dependance is all here hinted, which though ſome may extend farther then others, yet while its rule is not abſolute, nor its conſtant practice, there is no juſt ground for exception; by this its plain, the Laws muſt be equal, that is, reſpecting time, place, perſon, eſtate &amp;c. and ſo univerſal; now for the leading and conducting of theſe, whether to place the whole under a general Command, abſolute and ſetled, of a known Military Officer, or of a Civil Officer, as now the Sheriff; and the other to be ſetled by the Supream power, as need is, is worthy enquiry, yet eaſie to be determined; for if it be looked into, both will be ſeen neceſſary; for the ſetled Law of <hi>England</hi> alwaies allowed the power of the County to ſuppreſs Riots, &amp;c. and againſt obſtinate offenders and oppugners of the Publick peace; therefore the chief Judges in the County muſt have an Officer duly conſtituted, who ſhall ſee to the execution of the Laws; next to give the ancient Colonel or the Col. of Horſe in each County the chief truſt in order, reſerving ſpecial power of making an extraordinary Officer in chief, is (while Commiſſioners for the Militia are a Court reſident) the moſt (evidently) ſafe way. Now we are come to conſider a neceſſary engagement, and that is the pay of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Souldiers of the Trained Souldiers of the Nation. To this its eaſily anſwered, if in actual ſervice pay is neceſſary, the doubt is only in time of peace; now not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh of peace as ſetled peace, and diſturbed peace, intervalls of peace and war, or outbreakings or fears; I ſay in the moſt ſetled times, its fit the Officer have ſome ſetled pay, be it more or leſs, as the Supream power thinks fit. I ſhall not enlarge concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that; what the age of Souldiers is, is not ſo needful; ours is the beſt way that requires an able man of body, and of this the Commiſſioners are abſolute Judges. Its not much requiſite with us what rank a Horſman be of, eſpecially if the State be mixt Monarchy, ſo called, or Republical; for honours engage not to a dependance, that is, ſhould not but as the Law requires.</p>
                     <p>For offences done in the field, and as Souldiers, let them be tryed by the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for the Militia, without any form of complaint legal or in writing, that is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated, and let the Marſhal ſee the Judgement executed.</p>
                     <p>For all things which now the Heralds exerciſe in Office, and which the Lord Marſhal did take cognizance of, they ought properly to come to the Commiſſioners thereto appointed in the County; and that for the Militia is the fitteſt; for Honours aroſe from Arms, and with them let the Records of Honors remain.</p>
                     <p>The Liſts of them enrolled Souldiers;</p>
                     <p>Thoſe authorirized to make and fell Arms, Powder and Ammunition of all ſorts;</p>
                     <p>Let them alſo have the ſole power of watching and warding, but by a like head-rule of a proportionate charge, and let them have a ſet way by a joint conſent at Seſſions, or as is by the Supream Magiſtrate appointed to raiſe monies to pay, in caſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, ſuch as are imployed by them for the neceſſary peace of the County.</p>
                     <p>Let them appoint Superadviſors of Taverns, Inns, Alehouſes, &amp;c. and let them have their Licenſes from them, if allowed by the Juſtices at Seſſions, and you may make a Reſervation of a Rent to the State to defray charges; but to admit that entrance to increaſing gain, is a viſible in let to all villany, in enervating the good Law under colour of publick benefit, which is moſt carefully to be avoided, as the ſhelter to private kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries. Laſtly, the rule of puniſhments, that is the general Law of puniſhing mutinous refractory and diſobedient Souldiers, and that both in actuall ſervice, and alſo in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary muſters and trayning (or better to expreſs it, appearing in Arms) is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and ſome other way thought of, eſpecially for trained Souldiers who are not in conſtant pay, then caſhiering or taking away of Arms; for the deſpiſing of Arms is yet in mind, and the honour of the truſt of Arms is unknown; it muſt be corporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as whipping, with caſhiering ſome incorrigible, rude, unworthy perſon, or running the Gantlop, and this by the judgement upon vote of the Officers of Troop, Company, or Regiment, if the Regiment be there. Seek not many, but fit ſouldiers; but look none keep Arms but thoſe charged or allowed by the Militia or Juſtices, as now one is fit, if not of neceſſity.</p>

                     <p>I have now but one word to the Commiſſioners and Officers, and in them to all Officers of Truſt, Judges, and others, be ſtrict in your duties to your Supreams, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire nothing but juſt things, and obedience will flow of it ſelf; it is the Military power that in all alterations of State gives forth the Rule of Government; from their order is the Nation ſetled: Reduce therefore your Diſcipline to a juſt and ſetled Rule, and then each one labor to beget this opinion in your Souldiery, which is truly a Chriſtian as well as prudent humane Maxime, That the riches and ſafety of the Maſter is in the emulation of ſervants; but as that, ſo this muſt have a juſt emulation; and by that the Army, and ſo the Commonwealth will be eſtabliſhed and preſerved; but this emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is fit to be a little better known; It conſiſts principally in the glory of doing good, but that doing good is materially in avoiding or hindring of evil: I mean they that will faithfully ſerve the Commonwealth, muſt not only keep the Laws themſelves out of conſcience of their own duty, but alſo ſee to, and as much as in them lies, that is, as lawfully they may in their places enforce the performance of them by others; the want of which hath ſo diſordered Civil Government, that he that requires or adviſes but the obedience to the Law, or a juſt and conſciencious regard thereto, is thought, nay called a buſy-headed fellow, a Roundhead, a pragmatick, ſelf-conceited, ſhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd fellow; Turks and Heathens will riſe up againſt us.

We come now to look at the civil ſettlement in the remainder; and firſt becauſe the criminal part of law is of moſt and greateſt concernment, as looking at the life of man, I ſhall therefore look firſt at that; now in this the difficulties cauſing difference are theſe; in an appeal, there muſt and ought to be witneſs beſides him that appeals; for he is the accuſer, and that either in his own right, or as next of kin, but all for private benefit. Secondly, there the dammages are to the party, and it is a perſonal thing proper to the complainer, and he may deſiſt when he will, and compound as he will. The Indictment is at the ſuit of the ſupream Magiſtrate, ſolely for the benefit of the Commonwealth, and the State hath all the goods, and all dammages; and the proſecutor, or complainer, is here a witneſs for the State, but at his own charge, which is as now uſed, unjuſt. The Intereſt therefore of the Magiſtrate &amp; the Subject ought here to be compromiſed rationally, for aſſuredly, if life goes for life, dammages are cut off as unfit, or of unequal value to be rendred for the life of a man; therefore the heir, or wife, or friend who ſhould bring an appeal, as I conceive, ought to have no forfeiture; ſome recompence may be, where the life is loſt, as in all caſes of Murders and voluntary conſiderate killings, and in all appointed duels, not in heat of blood, eſpecially if for ought the Law gives a remedy (for great abuſes diſpuniſhable by Law, it ſeems not reaſonable) but of this more after.</p>
                     <p>Now for to clear this, indeed it is requiſite that there be, as is juſtly ſuppoſed in Law, an Attorney for the State, whether called Clerk of the Crown, Clerk of the Peace, or what other name you will give him, ſetled in every County, who upon a ſet day each week, by vertue of his place, ſhould receive all complaints, and that upon oath, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being duly ſworn, and then by and with the conſent and advice of one or more Juſtices, ſhould frame an appeal generally, thus: I do challenge you <hi>A.</hi> for the peace of the Commonwealth, to anſwer to <hi>B.</hi> for the death, wounding, &amp;c. of <hi>C.</hi> whereof you are accuſed; and let <hi>B.</hi> and another witneſs make two witneſſes; and upon the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him guilty, let him be fined moderately, that is, ſo that at leaſt a fourth part of his eſtate be left him; The like Law alſo in caſe of Maym, wounding, &amp;c. whereof two parts to the party wounded, &amp;c. a third part to the State to bear all charges (for it is not fit to add charge &amp; loſs of time to him that is before oppreſſed) in caſe of life, let life anſwer
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:105181:97"/> life, unleſs by miſadventure, yet then he muſt be fined, but not to the party, but to the State, and that but to a third part of his eſtate reall or perſonal, to bear charges; and where the life is loſt, the charges muſt alſo be apportioned in like manner. For the leavying this, the way is before ſet: but for diſcovery of eſtate, there is the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; but in Lands admit no truſts for deceit, nor uſes to cheat, and the eſtate in the Land will be viſible: and take the goods in poſſeſſion at the time of death, and all is ſatisfied that can be expected.</p>
                     <p>Only let a ſet time be for Creditors to come and be ſatisfied; alſo that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth be ſatisfied, and the members not ruined, undone, and impoveriſhed: Thus ſhall both intereſts be ſatisfied, and the multitudes of legal quarrels by indictments, &amp;c. will be quitted, which have freed many rich Murderers, Poyſoners, &amp;c. and of other offendors multitudes, when there have been poor proſecutors. That this muſt be done in the County where the fact is committed, is owned; Let the transferring him from one County to another, when taken out of that County, be ſetled in an eaſie and ſpeedy way; and that a Judge be there ready to determine ſuch caſes, weekly, if not daily: however to examine witneſſes immediately upon Oath, (which all Juſtices muſt have power to give as they ſee cauſe; therefore make wiſe and honeſt Juſtices better then yet are) and let this be taken as evidence, as far as is credible, and let not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſtay a moneth, a quarter, a year for Tryal, and at unreaſonable charge: and as ſoon as gone, a Tryal; if ſtay, a flaw in the Indictment, though the Evidence be plain.</p>
                     <p>This was <hi>Englands</hi> old Law; and the reaſons are the ſame; the alteration was the ſweet benefit, not Juſtice or Righteouſneſs: Why cannot the Juſtices in Ordinary in the County, try Felons, Murders and Treaſons, as well by a ſetled Commiſſion as a Special one: And in all faults, the condition of the fault, and the quality of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought to be obſerved. In an Amerciament, or Fine, I would have but one word for all purſe-pains; for that is juſt, and is our Liberty of old, and now ought to be.</p>
                     <p>For Murderers of themſelves, and Murders and Manſlaughters by unknown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, let ſuch rule be as is proportionate for Fines, to deterr, not ruine Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and enquiry in all by one ſpecially appointed, as with us <hi>per</hi> Coroner; but let his power and Fee be certain, that he encroach not on the Office of the Juſtice, who is but Inquiſitor; yet it might be better to give every Juſtice that power. For Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dands, let the Law be ſetled by ſome Rule of proportion, which our Law books hold not forth but ſolely for the advantage of the Crown ſo called; yet under the Right of God as the Prieſts portion, this ſeems wholly ſuperſtitious.</p>
                     <p>For words threatening life, let good Sureties be for the peace; and let due pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and evidently hearty confeſſion of his unchriſtian walking be before remiſſion. This will quiet all double Controverſies. For of ſuing firſt an Appeal and then an an Indictment, firſt Indictment, and then action, brings that there is no end of labour.</p>

                     <p>Now in all known caſes, and juſtly ſuſpected, every one may apprehend without a Warrant, yea if but juſtly, that is, upon ſtrong preſumptions ſuſpected becauſe of flying; but in caſe of but probable lighter and leſſer ſuſpitions, no man ought to be apprehended but by Warrant, that is, the cauſes of Suſpition allowed by the Juſtice, the Warrant is to be granted; if he denyes, the party may go to another; and where ever juſt ſuſpitions be, or a warrant, the party complaining, except the informations be feigned, or cauſes of apprehenſion meerly ſuggeſtions, no ſuit ought to be; and in caſe the perſon be obſtinate and dangerous, or the number many, the Civil Officers may undoubtedly crave the aſſiſtance of the Military power of the Nation, if any be ready, or otherwiſe raiſe them, and it is no diſpriviledge at all.

                     <head>How Debts are to be Recovered.</head>
                     <p>HAving briefly paſſed theſe Heads, I come now, before I come to treate of the way and manner of Trials particularly by twelve men, to treate of the Civil Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy as diverſe from Criminal, and look at that as it looketh at Liberty, Goods, and good Name.</p>
                     <p>And in this I ſhall paſs over the Introductions to Debts, which are Trading, Bargaining, Selling, Giving, Granting, Bequeathing, and the like, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences thereof; now as to this all Revenge is but beſtial, Satisfaction is Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
                     <p>Now the ſatisfaction muſt be either from Lands or Goods; Lands for the benefit of Poſterity ought to be preſerved as much as may be; therefore till there appear no Goods, there ought to be no Proceſs againſt Lands; but as the evil preſent is alwayes heavieſt, ſo the liberty of the Parent is to be eſteemed above the future advantage of the iſſue, and then the lands are to be ſold.</p>
                     <p>Our Law holds forth things juſt enough; I cannot in my conſcience but ſay the fault is principally in the Practiſer and the Judge; the one to move unjuſt things, the other to determine them; although I believe many of the Errors were brought in upon Prudential grounds, rather then Legal, or to avoid the rigidity of the Letter originally.</p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:105181:98"/>
                     <p>For thus it ſtands, the Law being thus anciently, that firſt Goods, then Lands, then Liberty was to be ſeiſed for debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon a juſt and proportionate Rule, neceſſity found wayes to evade: Quaere the Goods, and they were others; Quaere the Lands, and they were aliened; and to run through the difficulties of all theſe Trials, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then was found too great, and therefore the Law of impriſonment at firſt by Atreſt was brought in; That it is againſt Priviledge, that is as uſed, I believe it highly; but that it is againſt Priviledge duly uſed, is not to be deemed.</p>
                     <p>We ought in all things to remember we are Chriſtians; our profeſſing well, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing ill, makes bad Chriſtians, nay meer civil ones Atheiſts, and keeps good Heathens from Converſion; Surely now, we by our Laws make ſuch multitudes of poor, that we ſee no way to relieve them, and therefore we exact not the Law of common diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice; I dare not be too bitter; The Lord write upon the hearts of Magiſtrates ſuch (let me ſay Chriſtian) affections, that the poor may be rightly maintained; but that is not my task here, therefore I proceed.</p>
                     <p>If any Debtor be, let the Creditor come to a legal Officer appointed, and there Avow in the word of a Chriſtian, that ſuch a one is truly indebted to him in ſo much, and ſhew particularly how; if the publike Officer knows the man reſponſal, let the Debtor be immediatly ſummoned to anſwer to the Creditor for ſo much, be it by Bill, Bond, Book, Promiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the Officer knows not the Creditor, then let the party be ſummoned, and if he denies the debt, then let one legal Witneſs (for all men are not to be admitted Witneſſes) Avow; by that I mean a Proteſtation in the name of a Chriſtian as before a Magiſtrate, that he knows the thing; then if the party ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies not the debt by a day, let a Plea be entered.</p>
                     <p>No more but thus; <hi>A.</hi> of ſuch a place, impleads <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>C.</hi> for ten pounds which he ows him upon a Bond or Bill, or as the matter is.</p>
                     <p>Then let the Debtor anſwer thus; <hi>B.</hi> to the complaint of <hi>A.</hi> for the debt of ten pounds, denies the debt, promiſe, Bond, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or pleads ſo much paid, and tenders the reſidue, with ſubmiſſion to the Order of the Court.</p>
                     <p>If he appears not, let an other ſummons go by way of exacting the party or parties to appear under the penalty of the value of the debt; if he appear not, nor any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torny for him being warned, let the goods be immediately ſeiſed and inventoried by one ſworn man or more, and apprized by ſworn men, as they are truly worth, then to be bought at the firſt hand, to the utmoſt of their knowledge; and let one Juſtice of the Peace adminiſter the Oath, to appear equally and indifferently between Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Debtors; then let a Jury of twelve or ſix men, ſuch as ſhall be lawfully called of the next neighbours, capable of the great truſt of ſuch Judgement, ſufficiently qualified with eſtate to recompence, knowledge to diſcern, and faithfulneſs to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge, for ſuch ought all Juries to be, and then the Trial by Juries is excellent, where the matter needs, or will bear the delay, except you ſhall ſo enforce obedience, that Trials may be ſpeeded as called; then the debt proved, let not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be till all Creditors be called in, and then let their debts alſo be proved, not allowing above forty dayes for all, and then let the goods be divided into three parts, if there be no other eſtate; otherwiſe three parts of the whole be diſtributed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionately as the reſpective debts amount, a third part ſaved to the Creditor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the ſame Trial that ſettles the goods, let it paſs the lands, and let the Seiſure of the Land and Sale be by the publike Magiſtrate, but all enrowled in a Book for that purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>I write not this to deſtroy, but enlarge the Subjects Priviledge, who now by the practike part of Law are deprived of the juſt end of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and all elſe. I know there is a conceited humerous generation, that are content with nothing but the Letter of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and others as much againſt it; I ſhall equally walk equally between them; It was then a good boundary to the Prerogatives of Princes, and power of Judges; and it were better to follow that truly now, then to be again ingulphed in as vaſt an Ocean as no Law, in the variety, multiplicity, and difficulty of Laws; for how many things, literally obſerved, would plainly much prejudice the Commonwealth; but I proceed.</p>
                     <p>Lands then in caſe of doubt muſt receive a Trial, as for other matters of value, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a publike Judge, the courſe by a ſhort complaint, at a day ſet for both parties, with their Witneſſes preſent, who can prove the matter in queſtion, or upon Oath made that they are ſick, or ſuch Caſe as is allowed upon Oath taken before a Juſtice of Peace; the <hi>Affidavit</hi> of ſuch perſons may be read, atteſted under the Juſtices Hand and Seal.</p>

                     <p>SUrely, the knowledge of the Laws municipal, and juſt, and righteous, ſetled Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of Nations, which are Laws, are highly to be honoured, eſteemed, and provided for; they are the left eye of the Nation, as the inſtructers of the Nation in the knowledge of divine wiſdom are the right eye.</p>
                     <p>Now to draw men to ſuch labours, there muſt be ſome allurements; we had ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that of late years it drew all the prime wits and parts of the Nation that way, and all the Courts being at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the whole Nation during the ſo called Terms, was void of requiſite Government; for theſe wits to maintain and encreaſe their honour and riches, had made the Law ſo difficult, that good honeſt Knights and Squires in the Counties, yea though they had ſtudied the Law, durſt not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon a matter extraordinary; how then ſhould Citizens? and theſe, and the Attorneys, by the adjudges tricks and niceties, had buried Juſtice paſt finding out by Juries; each man had his legal quillet to deceive the honeſt man, prejudice the State, and yet ſatisfie his ſo called conſcience.</p>

                     <head>Whether ſervitude be lawful among Chriſtians? &amp;c. And whether fitting, or not?</head>
                     <p>SUrely the Almighty wiſdome appointed nothing in it ſelf but juſt, and that juſtly, yea above other Law-givers, who from want of prudence, oft multiplied ſervants to ſuch numbers as they oft oretopped their Maſters and the Laws; but the Lord by allowing ſervitude among his people, yet limiting it for a time, gave ſatisfaction to juſtice every way; the proprietor was ſatisfied by labor, where eſtate failed, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant had his day of freedom, and the danger of multitudes was never obnoxious to them; for we ſee the Lords and great men offended in forcing ſervice, but not the contrary; ſervice therefore well limited, is held by many and thoſe prudent men, and godly Chriſtians, no way diſſonant to the Liberty, nay equality of the Goſpel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by Chriſt we are brethren, and fit to be practiſed as well as bound Apprentices, but with well tempered Laws.</p>
                     <p>As firſt the power not to extend to life or mayme, next not work above ſo many hours in a day, then to be cloathed againſt cold, and fed for Natures ſuſtenance, that is, he ſhall be better then in a priſon; the greateſt difficulty will be to make ſervants of wife and children; for it ſeems to ſome unreaſonable, that they ſhould be made ſervants: Our Heralds in many heads have made ſuch ſhatters, that they cannot think fit a high-born man or woman, or the like (which are accidents of inferiour provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as I may call it) ſhould be ſubject to the univerſal Law of Mankind; but certain it is, if all Debtors, &amp;c. pay or ſerve, theſe men ought not to be excluded; but that the women muſt follow the condition of man, is not of neceſſity, no more then to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, &amp;c. ſhe muſt be miſerable, but needs not be in ſervitude, nor the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                     <p>Now the Law-maker ought to ſettle ſomething againſt them, upon two grounds; Firſt, of ſatisfaction; ſecondly, of aw or fear; upon this ſcore to make the children and wife ſuffer, would do much as ſome think; but I conceive otherwiſe; for ſelf is generally neereſt: Next for children, it would or might ruine education, whereby the publick loſeth more then the private gains.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, for the wife, if all parties be pleaſed, let them come and ſerve together; otherwiſe not; But under the Law of mercy to ſhew mercy and love, let the evident poor man be diſcharged, as before, with ſomething to begin the world; but once more repreſs idle houſes of all ſorts, vanity in Apparel, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>I Take Uſury to be a Covenanting for to receive the principall with intereſt; Now the reaſon of the coming to a ſetled way of uſe by particular perſons, that is, twenty, fifteen, ten, eight, ſix, or four in the hundred, was upon conſent of parties to avoid tedious and deceitful accounts and reckonings, and the like, (the Laws ſettles it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void exceſſive gripings) juſt as in Lands the Tenant hires now at a certain price, and puts the gain in his pocket; truth is, we are a light, looſe, proud, lazy, prodigal Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; for we have had much liberty, educated under no reſtraint, aw, nor fear, no reverence of youth to Age, of people to Magiſtrates, of poor to rich, no order, all men now Maſters, all brave, all for back and belly; this ſpends faſt, and gains are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and oft all loſt, and then the fault is uſe-money: I pray what difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween being undone by a cruel racking Landlord, or a biting hard-hearted Uſurer? you will ſay all one; He that gains little by Land or Money, cryes, I had rather take money, and hire Land to give account; I am undone; ſome by being unfit to manage Land, or Money; others by ill managing of it; he that thrives, will never agree to this; no, that were to be alwayes a ſervant: Again, ſome will over-purchaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and receive four in the hundred in Lands, and pay eight; and this ruines them; others have good Trades, in debt, purchaſe, pay uſe, and thrive; Nay it is certain, Money is a more poſſible way of great increaſe, then Lands; and the Complaints even in all Nations much what alike; therefore I conclude as to that it is fit to regulate letting out of Moneys; but it is alſo fit to order ſome proportion for Lands, or give a Rule for Landlords, that ſqueaze a poor ignorant labouring creature, as we do a Honey-comb; let neither be permitted unjuſtly; and for rich Tenants, let them not defraud the Commonwealth.</p>
                     <p>This premiſed, Uſury in it ſelf may be lawful, if not forbidden; now if it be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, let me ſee where it is; if it were Typical, it is aboliſhed; if judicial gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, it is rational, that is, all thoſe Laws hold forth the reaſon of commanding, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting plainly, and then let us ſee the reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Now if you take it judiciall ſpecially, as proper to the Jew, then it muſt by like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon run thus, Take no uſe of thy Brother a Chriſtian; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation hath it poor Brother, which to me plainly hints the Law, and its reaſon, and that juſtly; and this not obſerved, is unchriſtian; ſo to impriſon for meer uſe, the principal received, much more all loſt; and that not by neglect, folly, or exorbitancy; for all theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Caſe in the Court of Chriſtian Conſcience; but for rich men to detain uſe is unjuſt, or if able to pay, for to plead it while cloathed as Princes might be, is a ſhame to the Governours; God hath not bound us Chriſtians to Laws of meats, particular Judicials, wherein the command was onely to try obedience, therefore regulated; it is without queſtion as lawful as letting of Lands, much more lawful then buying for three pence in the ſeaſon of the year, and for half a years benefit of laying out of the money, to get twelve-pence, fourteen-pence, which is ten fold, nay one hundred-fold worſe uſury then twenty <hi>per cent.</hi> yet this is uſual and never ſtumbled at; but to double is counted lawful neceſſary gain; how ever if the Law allows not, let it not wink; I now come upon the rule of like reaſon to Quaere,</p>

                     <p>I firſt examine, whether Chriſtianity allows it; I might firſt have determined, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature allows it; for if Nature ſeeks Self-preſervation, it allows it not; then ſurely it is unnatural to force to overthrow Self; it is agreed, many deteſtable Murders, Rapes, Adulteries, Treaſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the preſervation of States, and glory of God, in juſt puniſhing of offenders, have hence ariſen; but this may be Gods mercy to bring good out of evil.</p>
                     <p>Our Rule is, Let's not do evil that good may come of it; Now this hath alſo been manifeſted, that much evil have come of it; not onely many Innocents have ſuffered in it, but by cruelty have been falſely accuſed by ſuch parties, eaſie natures being drawn, and in the torment have ſpoken any thing; ſo that it is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule, and if no certain Rule, and a ſevere puniſhment, and that of one not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, it is not onely unchriſtian, but irrational; the vain Chriſtian I know, is ready enough to ſeek aſſurance againſt fears by ſuch extremities; but it is better to truſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, beſt ſo to live as not to fear to die; I ſhall not enlarge in this, which is ſo plain, but haſte and conſider</p>

                     <p>I need ſay no more for Coppyholds; a wiſe unintereſted man will ſpeedily conclude the reaſon of the inſtitution of the Tenure is gone.</p>
                     <p>Truly you Lords of Mannors, you it concerns, I pray conſider upon what grounds you hold Courts, ſwear men, Fine at pleaſure, ſeize goods, or deſtrain; a cunning Lawyer might find you all in the forfeiture of all your Mannors: How many Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors have ſprung up ſince Prohibition? but this is but by the By; the State may look to ſuch Chequer Rents and forfeits in time; but to the thing it ſelf.</p>

                     <p>Laſtly, incertain Fines are wholly unjuſt; and above all the dependences of Free men; for now Coppyholds is alſo become each mans purchaſe, yea Free mens; this is clear againſt the original Conſtitution; and the reaſon ceaſing, the Law ought to ceaſe; but if the intereſts of Lords prevail for the preſent, that there be no totall abolition of the name, and remembrance of that Tenure, no more then of <hi>Capite</hi> and Knights Service, which is equally juſt; yet let the Commonwealth have its due freedom, let the Fines be made certain, one years clear value, which cannot be above two parts in three.</p>
                     <p>Next, No forfeitures; next to paſs by free deed; laſtly, all as Free-hold at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, except onely the Rent; for it is better enlarge the Rent and have no Fine.</p>

                     <p>But firſt, every Caſe is not worth ſuch trouble; but Juſtice muſt be done in every Caſe; and unleſs you will pay Juries for their pains, they cannot travel; therefore to avoid this, you muſt make Judges in every Town; and though the letter of the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is general, yet do but the Juſtice of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Subject will not complain. Juſtice never wrought diſpriviledge, and is above <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceed with Jurors, let's ſee how Caſes ought to come to the deciſion of Juries, then what Juries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it is juſt, that before any ſuit be, the party wronged ſhould firſt privately ſeek peace, then call the party before a Magiſtrate to know what the difference is, and ſee if it yet may be compoſed; if this will not do, let a Magiſtrate allow a legal controverſie.</p>
                     <p>Then let his Caſe be ſet down ſpecially as it is, after the nature of an Action upon the Caſe, and let Oath be of the truth of it, and that he is able to make it good by Law; let the Caſe barely be ſtated, no Conceits, no Opinions, but the naked truth, which the Complainant is to make good.</p>
                     <p>Let this alwayes be within twelve moneths after cauſe of Action. Then let a Summons go to the Defendant by a ſworn Officer from the Court, or the party, or ſome other making Oath of the Summons; if he appears not, let a Note be fixed to his door, (under a ſevere penalty to any one to take off) requiring appearance, or to ſhew Cauſe; if neither be done, let the Trial immediatly be awarded; if he appear, let the day of hearing be ordered and entered in the Court-book, (and that truly by the Clerk under a ſevere Fine, immediatly to be deducted by abatement in his Salary;) after which time, let a Jury of twelve or ſix men (for it is not the number that doth the work, I think ſix beſt; but that conteſt is not worth the while: the alteration of an old received way is the greateſt objection) be warned, not under the penalty of twenty, or one hundred pounds, and nothing ever paid, but of ten or five ſhillings, to be aſſuredly levied to the States uſe immediatly of Courſe, unleſs ſick in bed, or otherwiſe imployed in the Service of the Commonwealth in the County above twenty miles, or hindred by Providence; which Cauſes ſworn and allowed, may excuſe or eſſoyn him; for not ſummoned, the Officer is ſworn, and muſt admit no preſent conteſt.</p>
                     <p>Now the men muſt be knowing, underſtanding men, and of eſtate to anſwer dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, (if that be continued) if they give a falſe Verdict, which is juſt, being they are properly Judges of the dammage: now if they and the Judge differ upon the Law, let them do it at their peril; for the Caſe, let it be ſtated, the Judges and their hands with the Counſel preſent ſet to it, and let the yearly Judges decide it; and if the Judge be faulty, let him, otherwiſe the Jury be fined to the State; and if they give a falſe Verdict, that is, go not truly according to what is truly alledged and proved, unleſs they or ſome of them of their own knowledge know the thing of which they are bound to give the Court publike Cognizance; for Juries as other Judges are under a Rule of Reaſon and Common Juſtice.</p>

                     <p>Laſtly, he muſt not be who is a Jury-man, a common Swearer, Drinker, Company-keeper, nor ejected any congregation as an evil perſon, an offender againſt the peace and quiet of the Nation, or one that hath declared his opinion before ſworn: It is agreed, it is beſt object againſt the Juror before ſworn, but what the court is miſtaken in, ought not to be proceeded in; therefore till they be as we ſay gone from the bar juſt objections may be offered; but the Judge muſt not allow objections as to favor or ſurmiſes after ſworn; if it be, let it be proved (for let no Juror after ſworn be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, but the reaſon recorded) and this proof is eaſie, and then let him be fined.</p>

                     <p>THis is a matter of large extent, and is one of the great ſores of <hi>England,</hi> which wants healing.</p>
                     <p>Our Commons are either appendant, appurtenant, or by reaſon of vicinage, and were originally the relief of the beaſts of the Plow, and for the breed of young Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel for the Freeholders, and do primarily belong to them; and as their Farm was, ſo might they put upon the Common greater or leſſer quantity of Cattel, according to proportion.</p>
                     <p>But long ſince the rule of Commoning was loſt, and Commons are become the ruine of the generalty of the poor, to whom Commonage belongs not.</p>
                     <p>For firſt they get a Cow in Summer, and live idlely of that, and not providing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt winter, they buy dear in the Spring, and ſell cheap at winter; and the rich, ſo long as the purſe payes not, few regard how things go; by this at laſt miſerable and remedileſs beggery enſues, beſides the general neglect of Commons, as of all matte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> of publick intereſt, whereby many poor are undone by loſs of their beaſts, the ground ſpoiled, and not half improved.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, no due extant viſible rule ſet, which ought to be in all Counties anew, and Rules for dreyning and improvement, beyond what the Commiſſion of Sewers can reach.</p>
                     <p>To avoid this, it is neceſſary, as in other matters, to empower ſome Gent. to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Commons (give them only their charges neceſſary at a ſet rate) let them have power (if you can pitch upon truſty perſons) to ſettle Commons if you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them; otherwiſe to part them proportionably, and improve them by ſeveralties, leaving a ſet part to the poor only, to be improved for them, according to order of the Commiſſioners, by the overſeers for the poor, and the order recorded in the County-Book for that purpoſe; and alſo in the Town, or Towns, if there be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communing; this is the beſt way of the two, as by experience meeting with more evils, and remedying them, then the other way is capable of, in a preſent ſettlement, and is aſſuredly far more durable.</p>
                     <p>Let free Warrens, and Fold-courſes be conſidered, but not at the height, and ſetled where they pleaſe in ſeveralty; this, if wiſely and prudently ordered, will afford not only a great and moſt conſiderable improvement, but will afford a mean of ſetling the Nation; and may now be done without danger of Inſurrections or Tumults; And let but the ſetling of Tenures be carried on rationally, plainly, and prudently with it, and the Generalty of the Nation will aſſuredly ſee the clear benefit of change of Government.</p>

                     <p>IF Jurors be to have knowledge and eſtate, and that in ſuch manner as may anſwer the Truſt, then ſurely in ſome meaſure witneſſes, upon whoſe evidence the Jury is ſworn, to lay the foundation of their judgement ſo called Verdict, ought to be men fit to be beleeved; The Law principally looks firſt at infamy, eſpecially perjury; but this being legal perjury, the puniſhment was ſo penal, and the Law ſo difficult, that few were complained of, fewer attainted.</p>
                     <p>Now this is ſure, moderate puniſhments, ſeverely executed, curb more then ſevere puniſhments remiſly or not at all. The Law in the next place lookt at Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for relations they are not valued in Law as to witneſſes.</p>
                     <p>Aſſuredly he ought who is a legal witneſs to be of ſufficient underſtanding, next not convicted of notorious crime; for juſtly what is the cauſe of rendring a man uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the benefit of the Law, or rejection of Church-Society, ought to be admitted if proved, a good plea againſt the witneſs; yet let ſuch a man ſpeak, but not upon oath; for he that obeyes not man for Gods ſake, nor God for his own, is not be allowed to call God to witneſs; for in his acts he denyes him, though with his mouth he owns him. If it be askt, Why heard?</p>
                     <p>Then I anſwer, he may ſpeak truth, but is unworthy that ſacred Teſtimony.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Magiſtrate muſt from his words and probabilities and circumſtances, and ſo the Jury gather the truth of the matter; but where the man is capable of oath, let him be ſworn, whether 'twixt the State and Subject, or Subject and Subject; for right is the ſame.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo neceſsity to hear the wickedeſt mans Teſtimony, though not ſwear him, becauſe we cannot alwayes chuſe witneſſes; therefore eſtate is not requiſite, nor can be ſtood upon in witneſſes, as in Jury-men, who are to be choſen.</p>
                     <p>For point of favor; I find in this Age it is of great importance; for ſuch relations in Nature are generally preferred to, (though unworthily) relations either of Countrey or City, earth or heaven; few men leave all for Chriſt, Truth or Juſtice ſake; Therefore I would admit the notice of alliance, but not the objection, and hardly carry it upon ſuch a ſingle Teſtimony.</p>

                     <head>Whether Duels be lawful or not? and other Trials by fire, and water, &amp;c. As in the trial of Witches, ſuſpition of Adultery, &amp;c. and all doubts.</head>
                     <p>I Shall firſt treat of Duels, which is without queſtion unlawful in all Caſes, yea of the greateſt doubt.</p>
                     <p>But firſt to ſpeak to plain Caſes, moſt of which are diſgraces, affronts, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> for which the Law gives none, or not conſiderable ſatisfaction or reparations: Now it is clear in Law and Reaſon, that when words and ſigns become dangerous and prejudicial, the Magiſtrate ought to provide accordingly to repreſs; King <hi>James</hi> made very rational orders in the very cauſe of Duels, but ſaw them not executed; which diſguſted the moſt diſcreet ſpirits; but it was evident, the catch was but to halter the great men in the Springe of the Star-Chamber Law; ſuch policies never throve yet; Piety when the end is Gods Glory, with the peoples good (not particular perſons intereſt) is the beſt policy.</p>
                     <p>Let therefore the Magiſtrate no longer count words light, while they bear the weight and price of blood, but repair every breach, give a juſt recompence for every loſs, and then puniſh tranſgreſſors ſeverely in ſuch Caſes; for many think they may juſtly become their own avengers where thc Law affords no remedy.</p>
                     <p>The example is evident in ſtealing Dogs, ſo called for pleaſure, which hath coſt Lives and Ears.</p>
                     <p>The Lord Marſhall did take notice of ſome of theſe matters, but not all, and that with ſuch delay and difficulty, that the parties were better try it ſhortly; therefore for all words, give ſpeedy remedy; let the complaint come preſently to the Judge, and receive a trial accordingly as the Supream Magiſtrate ſhall order.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond part, which are difficulties, ſuſpitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we have no infallible word to warrant it; the practiſe aroſe rather from Heatheniſh Superſtition, then Chriſtian Faith; therefore we are to leave them to Gods judgement, and ſettle the matter ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome other way, as of lot in Caſe of doubts in civil claims, which aſſuredly is lawful.</p>
                     <p>But as to the other ſuſpitions, there the cauſes of ſuſpition are to be examined, and if approved, they are either evident or doubtful; if evident they convict; if doubtful, they render ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>Now in all Caſes of ſuch Tendencies to ſuſpition, if the parties ſuſpected walk ſtill ſuſpectedly, they are to be puniſhed, but not to the height of puniſhment; and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt increaſe as crime does; but to entertain jealouſie too far is dangerous. Therefore let all Magiſtrates ſee ſome grounds before they admit Queſtion, more before they puniſh.</p>
                     <p>For the Ordeals, were they an infallible certain Rule, they might be uſed; but for want of that, they are unwarantably made Laws where ever uſed; and therefore where uſed, to be rejected.</p>

                     <head>What Religion the Magiſtrate is to ſettle; or his Duty and Power therein. Whether, and how there be, or may be two Supreams.</head>
                     <p>I Have Implicitly ſcattered ſome opinions tending to the reſolution of a great part of this Queſtion, which I ſhall not again meddle with; my intention here being onely admitting the Magiſtrate Chriſtian, to Quaere his duty in the variety of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo reflect a little upon our preſent doubts, and dicuſs them ſo far as may tend to ſettle, not divide; for for ſome high opinions of the Churches Power over the Magiſtrate, and for the eſteemed obſtruſe and difficult opinion of the Magiſtrates acting as a Church Officer; both intending, notwithſtanding their expreſſions, a juſt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:105181:106"/> latitude to the Supream Power, but ſpecially exalting Chriſt and his Kingdom above all, yea though alledging the very words of the Pope, That no Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate but muſt be a Church-Member, and ſo inferior to the Church it ſelf, whereof he is a member; for the Officers, as he is a member, muſt give him the Rule, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, yea though he were a Paſtor or Elder himſelf.</p>
                     <p>I conceive this ſhort Tract, wherein ſo many particulars are briefly hinted, onely to draw them into diſcuſſion, is not fit to open that controverſie, which muſt be with much Wiſdom, Prudence, Judgement, and ability of divine Learning diſcuſſed, or it will but cloud more, and tend to heighten the differences of intereſt twixt Church and State: I ſhall therefore (for the preſent at leaſt) forbear to open that Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, and look onely at the Magiſtrates duty generally; for his power, I make it the Handmaide onely to his duty.</p>
                     <p>Religion therefore being the proper object of the ſpirit of the inward man, is not the proper ſubject for the Magiſtrate as a man, nor of his power, no not though a Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>Yet while there are Hypocrites in the world, and the Notion of Religion may veil Treaſons and Obliquities to the State, being and well-being of the neighbour; it is the Magiſtrates duty to ſee to theſe, as before; but as to the particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of Chriſtians, in, and concerning, or Doctrine, or Diſcipline, it is not clear that the Magiſtrate hath ought to do in it, while the outward peace be not diſturbed thereby; I will exemplifie generally.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe the Doctrinal Quaere be, How many Sacraments? Or whether Baptiſm came in lieu of Circumciſion, or diſcent from the particular ſeventh day as a Sabbboth, and the like.</p>
                     <p>We ſee plainly, that while the Magiſtrate uſed his power according to his opinion, as the Magiſtrate inclined, ſo matters went generally; and the oppoſites in opinion oft crucified each other, ſeldom converted.</p>
                     <p>Therefore aſſuredly, in theſe difficulties of Faith among Chriſtians, let the Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Exhortations, Perſwaſions, Convincements of the Church be urged, let not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward force be uſed.</p>
                     <p>It is well known, the great cauſe of our Embroilments now, is the difference pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, betwixt thoſe of the Congregational way, and thoſe of the Pariſhional Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined way; I have purpoſely omitted this matter to this concluſion of the Work, to ſumm up all; for it is plain, the Controverſie ſtands thus, as is hinted in the firſt Part,</p>
                     <p>Whether the Churches are to be gathered anew?</p>
                     <p>Now to underſtand this fully, it is to be noted, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is counted Schiſmatical by <hi>Rome,</hi> renting from her, as ſuppoſing ſhe had ſo far parted from the Doctrine of Chriſt, as that there was no poſſible juſt Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with her, which the Puritan muſt ſtill hold, that is, the true Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter.</p>
                     <p>They all agree a Reformation neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>But they of the Congregational way ſuppoſe it cannot be a Reformation, but ſuch as is a new Congregating; that is, they own indeed what the Puritan ſuppoſed; That truly ſuch was the Apoſtacy of <hi>Rome,</hi> that there is nothing to be done with her; they own her not the Spouſe of Chriſt, but a Harlot <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> her ſiſter in the old way.</p>
                     <p>And it is moſt ſure, compare the Doctrine of Chriſtians, as to all ſorts of men and women, and all the actions of their lives; And aſſuredly, the beginning of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Governments from the light of Nature, gave forth greater and more glorious examples of Piety, Juſtice, Mercy, Fortitude, Truth, Charity, Love, and that to Enemies; Gratitude, Obedience to their Country, and to them ſet over them in any kind, and zeal for their gods; which I commend onely as far as it walked even pace with their profeſſion, then there is to be found among Chriſtians, and among Princes where they devoted themſelves to their Country and people, as among the both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>We have juſtly baniſhed Superſtition, and wickedly given free ſcope to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs; the lives of the beſt are ſo farſed with the rudiments of the fleſh, in eating,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:105181:107"/> drinking, cloathing, and exerciſing inordinately, and in immoderate care to maintain theſe, that the Goſpel is become a ſcandal and a ſtumbling block to many that are entrred the School of Chriſt, and have been mortified by many acerbities.</p>
                     <p>Yea, theſe have I ſeen to give way in their old Age to the vanities of youth, and that as might be feared through pride that God had given them a ſight of what they perſwaded themſelves to be the truth.</p>
                     <p>But that which is the ſpreading incurable diſeaſe of Chriſtendom ſo called, is, the looking to others moſtly, and neglecting ſelf, gadding and tatling, and the like, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now of all theſe aſſuredly there is evident power in the Magiſtrate to repreſs them, whether in the exceſſive vanity, in eating, drinking, cloathing or gameing; but thoſe more inward and heart vanities are to be repreſſed by a general prudent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The example of thoſe in Authority, and power, and their due exerciſe of that power where needful, is the great incentive to excellent vertue.</p>
                     <p>Now the conteſt of the Presbyter for a puniſhing power, and his looſneſs in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Members to his Church, makes the Eagle ſighted Magiſtrate jealous that what ever is acted by holy and religious men at firſt faithfully, yet if holding forth a liberty of Contention for Supremacy, ſome will attempt in time to claim of duty, while there are Wolves which will for lucre and intereſt ſake put themſelves in Sheeps cloathing, as heretofore hath been evidenced. But this the Magiſtrate in the preſent Age muſt eye wiſely and juſtly; that is, reſolving that the Lord Chriſt hath a Supremacy, which he muſt be alwayes ready to acknowledge, and alſo to give unto him.</p>
                     <p>Now in ths conteſt for the conſtituting of Churches otherwiſe then as it gives juſt cauſe of diſturbance to the peace of the Commonwealth, I ſee not that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate hach ought to do; It is yet a matter of ſcruple to many good Chriſtians, what Church there is in <hi>England,</hi> for that the Church is conſtituted National.</p>
                     <p>I believe moſt pretenders to Morality are aſhamed of it, plainly ſeeing, that it is not the Baptiſm of Water that makes a Chriſtian, but that of the Spirit; and the ſame deluſion works upon men to reſt upon Signs and Forms under the Goſpel as under the Law.</p>
                     <p>Yet the outward Church-fellowſhip, that is the firſt ſo called ſign of a true Church being with them, that is the Sacraments, and that profitable Sacrament of a Prieſt to adminiſter them, makes all within the Church, though there be no Officers, or them but meer Lay-men, ſo called Church Wardens, and Over-ſeers; and of theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences, and incongruities are our Pariſhes framed.</p>
                     <p>Let me therefore to clear things to the world a little open the Quaere of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational way of all ſorts, and their Opponents.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>1.</label> Firſt, Whether in ſo great an Apoſtacy as the very Form of a Church ſeems to be loſt, there ought not to be an agreement of Doctrine and Diſcipline according to the Primitive Rule, and meerly according to that to lay the foundation of Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>2.</label> Secondly, Whether in the admiſſion to ſuch fellowſhip in ſuch an Apoſtacy, and when yet the profeſſion brings along with it no danger to life or goods, there ought not to be a ſtrict examination, and from that ſome apparent ſigns of real holineſs, and true faith, with ſome meaſure of knowledge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>3.</label> Thirdly, Whether the Members ought not by an expreſs agreement made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Church, to which they Aſſociate, aſſent to that Doctrine and Diſcipline, and promiſe obedience to the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>4.</label> Fourthly, Whether theſe Members are to be admitted as they ſhall volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily and of their own will aſſociate, or as they inhabite, which is called Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>5.</label> Fifthly, In whom the power of Admiſſion and excluſion of Members reſts (or to ſpeak it in the Prelatick phraſe) Whether the Superintendent Paſtor, Biſhop, Officers, that is, the Claſſis reſpectively, or the Brethren, that is the whole Company of Believers, not excluding Paſtor and Officers, have the power of the Keyes, that is, may exerciſe all Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction ſave onely in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:105181:107"/>
                     <p>
                        <label>6.</label> Sixthly, Whether the limited Congregations, and that either in reſpect of multitude or bounds be warranted by the word of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>7.</label> Seventhly, Whether they are to meet in one certain place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>8.</label> Eighthly, What is the proper work of the miniſtery, viz. (whither converſion of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted ones) (which muſt ſuppoſe with us ſome baptized not converted) or only the confirmation and edification of Church members.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>9.</label> Ninthly, Whether the Paſtors, &amp;c. of particular Churches may not only teach to confirming and edifying of ſiſter-Churches, but alſo perform all other Acts of Paſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, &amp;c. Office.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>10.</label> Tenthly, Whether propheſie ceaſes, or be a perpetual inſtitution, ſo that they who bear no Church Office, may exerciſe their gifts as brethren, (which they oft do to the ſhame of the preſent ſo called Miniſtery, excelling them not only in life, but Doctrine, and alſo in the gifts of admonition, inſtruction, confutation, reprehenſion, perſwaſion and conſolation of the hearers) and that the body of the Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                     <p>Now to clear this, It is controverted, but not yet by the Congregation pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>1.</label> Firſt, Whether there be an infallible Miniſtry, not as teaching by an infallible word and giving fallible expoſitions, but ſuch as in their at leaſt publike adminiſtrations have an infallible Spirit to guide them.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of this Quaere is of principall concernment; for if ſuch there be, then aſſuredly their work is extraordinary, and then a ſetled maintainance for extraordinary men will to moſt judicious men ſeem incongruous, and if out of a ſetled place, more diſſonant from the univerſall ingagement which by the miſſion apoſtolicall is upon thoſe endowed with ſuch a Spirit.</p>
                     <p>If there be no ſuch men, and that that ſpirit viſibly is not exiſtent in ſuch men among us; Then the Quaere is by what Rule or upon what ground, Apoſtolical Succeſſion is claimed without Apoſtolical Spirits.</p>
                     <p>And then upon what ground they become Teachers of the people. If it be ſaid from humane Learning, then the work is by ſome thought properly the ſubject, if not ſoly, of the Magiſtrates power, and cognizance.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid Divine purely, then it is anſwered before, and muſt be proved either by the expreſs word, or working of the Spirit, or both; if mixt, that is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Divine and infallible word, but ſubject to a fallible conſtruction: Then we are in the round, for none will acknowledge their own opinion faulty.</p>
                     <p>By this it will appear that the particular Chriſtian is the keeper of the firſt Table, for none of theſe are in the whole infallible, Popes, Councels, Biſhops, Elders, Claſſes, Congregations, all erring, wandering, pleading infallibility and demonſtrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fallible.</p>
                     <p>For the age and Qualifications of Paſtors and Teachers, I altogether omit it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming if the greater be ſetled, the leſſer will alſo.</p>
                     <p>The Queſtion concerning the Admiſſion of Infants to baptiſme I omit, with the ancient Rites of Baptiſme where the perſons baptized ſtood up and received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: And only ſay that if no Rule were originally given for baptizing in Fonts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of fountains, no nor practiſed in the moſt flouriſhing times of the Church in all places Chriſtian, yet after commanded, then aſſuredly if the Church hath that latitude in the form, take it only ſo of a Sacrament, There is not ſo much amiſs in Romes Maſs as is ſuppoſed; and if the Church hath not that power, there is more amiſs even in the pureſt reformed Congregations then is yet diſcovered: And if ſo, then ſurely the Power of the Church muſt reſt in diſpenſing duely the plain word for edification, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, confutation, reproof, or exerciſing the diſcipline in rejecting the obſtinate and diſobedient.</p>
                     <p>And in doubtfuls and indifferents Chriſtian Liberty muſt conſiſt; provided that Liberty be not deſtructive to the civil peace in word or deed, or evidently tending thereto.</p>
                     <p>This now will allow both Magiſtrates and Congregation a reſpective bound, whereby both Antichriſt Lay and Clerick may not domineer, to the diſturbing of Conſcience;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:105181:108"/> for if in in <hi>Pauls</hi> time one eat fleſh, another Herbs, one meat ſacrificed to idols, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not, ſome kept dayes, others not:</p>
                     <p>Why this Ado, eſpecially with Chriſtians in a Church way? for in the Magiſtratick order ſurely he may (however he will) enforce, not prophaning the day he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points as aforeſaid; and though they onely of his opinion keep it regularly, yet none of any opinion ſhall deſpiſe it and him irregularly, and if they do and go unpuniſhed, be aſſured the Magiſtrate is in the greateſt fault, he is or looſe, or lazy, or both.</p>
                     <p>So for maintenance in this way, the Magiſtrate may clearly ſetle it and ought, (and that onely from a publike maintenance) for otherwiſe his people will grow pure beaſts in the form and ſhape of men; and to theſe he ought to ſetle a main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance competent; for humane induſtry is capable of humane ſatisfaction; this as Teachers; but as Paſtors, let the additionall maintenance be as Chriſtian duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
                     <p>Now to ſetle it as Tythes, were the What, and how, and where, and when, and to whom well ſetled, it cannot be unlawfull, that is to give a tenth; but to admit it as of duty to the Miniſter as to the Prieſt, to plead cuſtomes of and for Tything, as well as to deny cuſtomes of not Tything, are all equally abſurd, if throughly ſcanned; A maintenance, and that onely, is agreed due by all to them that Labour in the word and Doctrine; but the whole Miniſtery hath with us been ſo Generally corrupted, that not onely men have made or pretended conſcience to pay any Tythes to ſuch wolves in ſheepes Cloathing, but from the vanity, wickedneſs and perverſneſs of theſe men of corrupt minds, have queſtioned whither a miniſtry be.</p>
                     <p>Here is a hard task for the Magiſtrate; for he hath been neceſſitated to take that power into his hands, which at firſt himſelf queſtioned whither it were lawfull for him or not, but attempting and finding no danger preſent, the fear is now leaſt he ſhould not let go his hold.</p>
                     <p>I preſume this is clear, he may and will declare if he have any Religion, which he approves; this is moſt naturall; that he will eſtabliſh what he conſents not to, who can perſwade himſelf of it? all that I can ſay is, if he be a Chriſtian, let him with all meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and in the evidence of truth by all Chriſtian means labour to win all, but to enforce none but the wicked and diſobedient to juſt and righteous Lawes; The want of which is the great diſguſt of all good men: but I ſhall not enlarge here of that.</p>
                     <p>The Churches power then conſiſting principally, if not wholly, in things plain and evident, it is moſt certain that the Magiſtrates Power in ordinary ought not to ſtretch ſo high, much leſs exceed; that is to help where that with humane thoughts ſeems to come ſhort, as the Church hath hitherto held;</p>
                     <p>Now in this I ſhall ſpeak one word to the great and weighty conſideration of the Supremacy of power, and whither, and how, there be, or may be Two Supreams, which will a little clear up the way for amity amongſt ſo called Chriſtians of all opinions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt we muſt conſider the riſe of the controverſie is from the word of God in all the new Teſtament, wherein all words of ſaving knowledge are directed ſoly, wholy and onely to the Elect, Saints at leaſt by calling and profeſſion (which in their ſeaſon ſome think, nay beleeve ſhall govern the world) and at theſe as called out of the way of the world, to a more holy and ſpirituall ſerving of him.</p>
                     <p>Now ſome ſuppoſe this was to be done onely in a Church way, which both Papiſt, Greek Church and Proteſtants of all ſides agree, that is, that the Magiſtrate Ruling among Chriſtians in ordinary ought to be a Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>Now ſaith the Church of Rome, and all, as a Chriſtian he muſt be a member of ſome viſible Church; if ſo, he muſt be ſubordinate to the Pope, and a generall Councell ſaith the Pope; to a generall Councell and Fathers of the Church, lay the Biblers of old: To a generall Councell and the Kirke, ſay both the Lutheran and Calviniſtical Divines; All which, place the Power of the Church Authoritatively in the Officers or Officer Supream.</p>
                     <p>Now thoſe of the Congregational way of all ſorts diſtinguiſh as the reſt do.</p>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:105181:108"/>
                     <p>Firſt in that the Supream Magiſtrates are men, and ſo members of Churches, they are Subject to the Diſcipline of the reſpective Congregations and Churches, but as Magiſtrates they are diſtinct Officers in the world for the good of all men, and the peaceable and quiet Governing of thoſe committed by God to their charge.</p>
                     <p>Now as a member, he is inferior to the whole; And as a man he is Subject to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; But as a Prince, he is not Subject to the Church; for as the Prince cannot as Prince perform the Offices of a Paſtor:</p>
                     <p>So neither can the Paſtor, Officers of one or more Churches, intermeddle with the ruling power of the Prince as a Paſtor or Church Officers, in any of their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>Now for Supremacy, they who are Chriſtian Princes and Paſtors, will not ſtrive for the Supremacy of Power, but keep their fixt places. All Saints are now the Kings, Prieſts, and Prophets of the moſt High God; But more eſpecially the chief Magiſtrate in Ruling repreſents the Kingly Office of the Lord Chriſt, and the Paſtors and teachers the Prieſtly and Prophetical.</p>
                     <p>The Prince Governs the Commonwealth according to the Judiciall Law of the Almighty God, the Law of pure righteouſneſs laid forth in both the Teſtaments; And the Paſtors and Teachers and Elders Govern the Church in diſpencing the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Rules of the Goſpel: the Paſtor principally if not only in Preaching of the Doctrinall part of Chriſtianitie; the brethren appointed to teach, in opening the practicall part of Chriſtianitie.</p>
                     <p>I know that ſome hold, that all ought to come under the pure notion of Church Government, and all Magiſtrates to Rule as Church Officers; I allow it fit to be Queried; but I preſume it is the wickedneſs of our preſent age blinds our eyes, that we ſee not all that all of them who pretend to ſinceritie deſire; And I ſee not, notwithſtanding our variety of opinions, but that all that have not the mark of the beaſt, ſhall ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob,</hi> in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>By this it is plain there is in the Church of Chriſt, the Lord Chriſts Subſtitutes in Governing the Nations by the materiall ſword according to a Law of righteouſneſs, and Juſtice, which man may comprehend.</p>
                     <p>And there is the Lord Chriſts Subſtitutes in holding forth to the ſeverall Churches the Goſpel of Love; the one hath the ſword of Juſtice, the other that of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>In the order of Government, the Paſtors and all the Saints muſt ſubmit to the Supream Magiſtrate as to Chriſt the King.</p>
                     <p>As a Chriſtian, the Magiſtrate muſt ſubmit to the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of Chriſt, as a member of that body whereof Chriſt is the head, as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a Chriſtian, ſubject to the Ordinances of the Goſpel: As a Prince ruling juſtly thoſe committed to his charge.</p>
                     <p>It will be thought that this admitting of the Prince ſubject as a member, will make his power ſubſervient to the end of that particular Congregation to which he is aſſociated; And this will breed Emulation, and at laſt diviſion; Now let this throughly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the cauſe original; and the head of this fountain of bitterneſs being ſtopped, the ſtreams it is hoped will be dried up.</p>
                     <p>From whence doth all this proceed but from the opinion of the benefit of unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and from thence the neceſſity? and thus we War, that we might have peace, and inſtead of convincing by Love, and waiting the appointed time, when the viſion will aſſuredly make haſte and come, and will not tarry, we enforce; labouring as we think by humane wiſdom, politiquely to prevent the evils we imagine may grow to a diſturbance of the Peace of the Church; And ſurely this pride of heart and humane Wiſdom, this thinking ſo well of our ſelves, and looking at the opinions of Chriſtians more then the lives and converſations, which is next to the eye of every man, and whereby God, and Chriſt, and the Goſpel is viſibly diſhonoured, is the ſource or ſpring of the quarrels of Chriſtians: our duty in practicall Chriſtianity is ſo plain, and our converſation ſo contrary, that it is the Wonderment of a Moraliſt, and all our diviſions for Church Government.</p>

                     <p>Power, oh had we Power.</p>
                     <p>And what brethren, could you do with your Power? could you raze one opinion out of the heart of any conſcientious man, now after ſo many thouſand yeers (man leave this vanity) Chriſtian, now after ſixteen hundred yeers, learn to know the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart are only in the hand of the Lord; teach in ſeaſon, and out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to draw to the Faith; but let the Spirit of man be convinced of the duty of Faith; What ſenſe and reaſon, is capable of in the plain Law, enforce ſo far as to ſecure the peace, and expiate juſtly the offence.</p>
                     <p>For the Quaere of the power of Churches one over the other, I ſuppoſe it is beaten ſufficiently, and in whom the Power of ſetling of Paſtors, and Power of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation reſts.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now proceed, and as a neceſſary Quaere treate a little</p>
                     <p>Firſt of Impropriations, and then of Preſcriptions?</p>
                     <p>Impropriations to ſpeak plainly, are of two ſorts; the firſt called appropriations being the granting preſentative benefices to Religious houſes; The other was the freeing of ſuch Lands as were given to Religious houſes, from the payment of Tythes; the ground of this was the ſuppoſed vertue that was in the prayers of theſe Religious perſons; but indeed there was a knot of carnall Policy alſo, which was to keep the people ignorant by admitting little preaching, which was counted the mother and nurſe of Sedition.</p>
                     <p>Now this Arrow came not only out of the Popes quiver, but ſecular ſo called Princes, after he began, followed, till at length the Abbyes, Monaſtaries, Fryeries, &amp;c. had, abounding in riches, and thereby abounding in eaſe, growing Luxurious and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beyond belief, fulfilled the meaſure of their iniquities; and <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. was the inſtrument as aforeſaid to plague them, who yet looking rather at Lucre and Power temporall, then Religious duty, did not return the Benefices and Tythes into the Ancient courſe, but conveyed them ſtill along to the owners of the Lands of thoſe Monaſteries, &amp;c. to which they were annexed as they are ſtill continued.</p>
                     <p>Now as many had ſuch things by particular grant, ſo others held them, and ſome other onely by preſcription; but the not doing of three or four things, makes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation difficult.</p>
                     <p>Firſt the not ordering all Chriſtians in a Congregational way, either limited or parochiall, or abſolute, which is beſt, without which a choice of a juſt, ſafe and equall repreſentative (Chriſtian) will never be.</p>
                     <p>Next the not ordering all Annexations and Impropriations into the Common ſtock, for the maintenance of teachers Humane and Divine.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly the diſcharging of all preſcriptions, cuſtomes, Grants, &amp;c. of particular pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of old, either of places, times or perſons.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the ſetling one Law weight, meaſure and tenure preciſely throughout the Nation. Now to ſpeak one word of preſcription, I take it to be but only the continued Right of a particular perſon, or family, or now of a Corporation, Townſhip, &amp;c. So that upon due and full ſearch, it ſeems to me no more then a cuſtome in many places and caſes.</p>
                     <p>Now for this, the time of preſcription ought to be ſet certain; next the ſame ought after once pleaded, to be ſetled and publiſhed juſt as a cuſtome, ſo that no publike Right may not be publikely known, and the Juſtice of it owned; for many preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are as unjuſt as many cuſtomes, and equally to be diſallowed, as ariſing upon falſe grounds, evil in themſelves, or tending to the dammage of the publike.

                     <head>What Law the Chriſtian Magiſtrate ought to ſettle.</head>
                     <p>THis I ſuppoſe many will accompt a needleſs quaere, both in reſpect that the law judicial generally is formerly aſſerted requiſite to be the head law, and alſo a forme or kinde of ſetled proceeding in law, agreed to be principally according to the reaſon of the common law ſo called of the Nation, herein laid down as grounded on the word of God.</p>
                     <p>But my intent is a little to diſcuſs the rights of the ſo called common law, and civil Law, and whither it be fit to allow ſuch divers courts of ſo called divers laws, and to ſearch ſhortly whether they were originally one and the ſame, or not, which I really ſuppoſe they were; for it is evident that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the firſt writers of our laws uſe not the forme of words of the civil law, dividing the law into the tomes of the <hi>Digeſt,</hi> the <hi>Code,</hi> the <hi>Authentick,</hi> and the <hi>Feuds;</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet the rule of <hi>Juſtinians</hi> Inſtitutes which are an epitome of the Digeſt, is by them wholly obſerved.</p>
                     <p>Now the Digeſt or Pandect, that is the new called Inſtitutes (for they are various in names) I agree to be but the drawing of the multitude of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular opinions and judgements of many venerable ſages of the Law into one ſetled body of Law, containing variety of learning, upon particular Titles of law or head laws, which laws being grown exceeding voluminous and intricate, the Engliſh neglected them; and few being learned, they were under the ſword diſpenſed with, and politiquely brought into the Cloſet of the Conquerors breaſt; and as the condition of the Nation required, were enlarged or ſtreightned at pleaſure: And upon intereſt only, the municipal law or cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Law of the people was by ſome ſetled in oppoſition to the ſo called civil Law.</p>
                     <p>Now this intereſt was partly of Princes, who found the Civilian ſtill to draw ſtrongly towards the advancement of Papall intereſt; partly of the practizer, who hereby ſiding with the Prince, at laſt drew the Civilian into a narrow room, and got the name of common lawyer, as ſtudious of that law which was uſed and received among the people by tradition generally, and in time they got preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and liberties as we have ſeen eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>We have known the great ſtrifes that have been in theſe courts not out of conſcience of the intereſt of juſtice to be either more faithfuly, or more ſpeedily, and at a due rate executed, but to bring griſt to the Mill, as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters glory was to have a multitude of Auditors, no matter how few Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they would but ſcan his Doctrine, queſtion his life, and unleſs he were more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, ſcruple adding more to his former abundance.</p>
                     <p>So theſe mens honor, was, to have their courts packed with ſutors, that the ſeveral practiſer from the Judge to the dore-keeper might have his Fee; from theſe ſhifts grew the ſo called prohibitions, conſultations, &amp;c. And the poor Sutor was undone, while the Courts admitted Firſt with eaſe the Quaere, and then eagerly proſecuted their own dues and rights before his could be determined, which was ever ſlow paced enough.</p>
                     <p>This evidences the neceſſity of ſetled Fees in all places, and that from the ſupream Magiſtrate; This alſo clears the caſe that the ſupream Magiſtrate muſt admit but one Law in practice and proceeding, nor one ſort of Lawyers; he may for the advance of learning order the ſtudy of it in Latin and all the exerciſes.</p>
                     <p>But the practiſe all ought aſſuredly to be in the vulgar tongue of the Nation, and in that tongue to be conſtantly printed, and alſo all precepts and proceſſes of the Courts whatſoever; for the pure executing of juſtice is more to be eyed then humane learning; For as in the Eccleſiaſtick State, when the ordinances of men and unction of men are preferred above, and juſtle out the ordinances and unction of the Lord, the Church is Apoſtate:</p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:105181:110"/>
                     <p>So when intereſts overtop juſtice, and juſtice and righteouſneſs are become Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Topical heads, Hypocritical Colours to wilder the people, the State is alſo A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate; and as long as either of theſe work in Church or State, the Apoſtacy, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ruining Antichriſtian Apoſtacy reigns.</p>
                     <p>Therefore all the Courts of a well conſtituted Nation, a Nation that ſeeks the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and freedome of her people indeed, muſt have a body of Law proper to the Nation, and this muſt as before, be ſo ſetled, that every Subject may in due juſt and evident way partake the benefit of it; therefore it muſt all be common, and keep that name, that weak ones may not be offended, what law ſoever be ſetled; for it is moſt properly belonging to the Community.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, admit as little form as may be, yet I would ſettle the habits of Judges and practizers in all Courts, but by way of honor; for I intend but this one word, the glory of form is loſt where form is made Common, Scarlet, the ornament of Judges is the guard of a Groom in theſe daies.</p>

                     <head>Whither offices may be put to ſale.</head>
                     <p>IN a word this is the plain inlet to all corruption; admit this and your ſetlement muſt totter; to diſtinguiſh betwixt judicial places and other, is but to hook in a liberty to unlawful things by degrees; for all are officers tending to the execution of Juſtice, and it is unjuſt to pay too much, and to ſtay too long for juſtice, as well as to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied juſtice, or have falſe juſtice; Admit ſuch practiſes, and all evaſions of Law will be not only ſtudied but practiſed; one evill admitted, a thouſand follow.</p>
                     <p>That juſt and honeſt and wiſemen have done it, and do it, is not worth the while; the ſhort anſwer is, there is no man but errs, And ſooneſt in matters of intereſt, much more where cuſtome ſignes the lawfulnes of it; but a word to what makes it ſeem lawful.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe the place be eighteen hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> accompted, as the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celours was in the late Kings time; and Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> pay ſo much annually, <hi>viz.</hi> Two thouſand pound to Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Two thouſand to Lord <hi>Au.</hi> and at laſt hath four or five thouſand pound a year only to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>So the Prothonotary of the Common Pleas to pay eleven thouſand pounds for his place, and have eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen hundred or two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds a year, had he not better have had it freely, and only five hundred, then if he had died within a year, left his only daughter a beggar, and his Friends engaged only to purchaſe a more then neceſſary allowance? I could ſet down who had this money, how it was ſhared, unleſs wiſe and honeſt men then miſinformed me.</p>
                     <p>By this it is clear, that there may be a ſufficiency to ſettle the intereſts of the ſupream Magiſtrate, if they have wiſe and honeſt men to carry on the work, upon founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of certain Juſtice, and pay every officer, and the Supream Magiſtrate to be a gainer, however no looſer, but the people to be ſurely advantaged in the juſt proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and Iſſue of their litigations.</p>
                     <p>Now for the choice of Officers it is ſetled before; both in the qualification honeſt and skilled; and in due manner approved; and in places of many Officers, where aptneſs is by the courſe of ſucceſſion, if no objection bee, is moſt plauſible, but not to be tied to it.</p>
                     <p>Now the way to have good Officers, is to ſettle eminently juſt Judges; and to gain them, is not to have too many; and in yong States or beginnings this is of abſolute neeeſſity; for without it ruine is unavoidable.</p>

                     <head>The neceſſity of educating Sea-men, and the way of breeding them, and from that of the Politique Law to reſtrain eating of Fleſh.</head>
                     <p>THis quere is of great concernment to This Nation and Iſland; God is our ſupport; but the means which the Lord affords us, are not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in the firſt place we ſhall look at the way of encreaſing, and breeding Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners.</p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe it is clear to moſt intelligent men, that by the fiſhery, there by long being abroad in ſtormy ſeaſons, and high Seas, whither great gain invites them, they become not only inured to the Sea, but grow hardned and dreadleſs, their experience being much more then either a Merchant or man of War can atchieve; So that where they breed one able Mariner, a poor North Sea-man breeds Ten. And indeed from theſe are your great Ships manned.</p>
                     <p>I muſt therefore be the care of the Supream Magiſtrate eſpecially to provide for even theſe.</p>
                     <p>The firſt care is that they may fiſh ſafely, therefore the convoy ought to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
                     <p>Next when they come home, there muſt be vent for the fiſh; The obſtacle is the old ſuperſtition of the Lent, or the Forty dayes faſt: the juſt and prudent Magiſtrate can eaſily remedy this, by making it Twenty eight or Thirty daies.</p>
                     <p>There is an objection or two againſt the ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>Firſt religious or ſo ſuppoſed, juſt before Eaſter, and carries the time of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſetle it to begin upon a certain day of the Month yearly and that ſcruple is gone.</p>
                     <p>The next is Phyſical: then is the return of the year, and our bodies which ſhould then receive beſt nouriſhment, are filled by fiſh with cold and flatulent nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this may ſeem much to ſome, but it is not worth the while: for ſuppoſe there were nor fleſh nor fiſh, there is variety of meats to live on for a month in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I ſuppoſe two daies in a week truly obſerved to have no fleſh ſpent were better; for ſee how Lent was kept: lay in ſo much fleſh before as ſerved the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; And ſo it would be, ye will ſay, for two dayes in a week; I agree it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay truly obſerved: therefore as in the hiſtorical part I propound that the reaſon of every law be divulged, and conſcience from conviction of the benefit of it engaged to obedience, and no way like that, as the examples of Catholique abſtinence now manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>But if the Magiſtrate would uſe force, I ſhall offer the beſt and moſt reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable way, which is to ſend to every houſehold in every town ſo many fiſh at an equal and ſet rate by him, according to the number of his family, ſo many fiſh for every head by the year, accompting two daies in the week wholly for fiſh.</p>
                     <p>Now the benefit of the preſervation of yong Cattell, is great and warily to be provided for: therefore let the Magiſtrate enact, that all Lambe killed before ſuch a day ſhall be forfeited, and the killer and eater to forfeit a price.</p>
                     <p>So no Chicken, Turky, Duck or Gooſe till ſuch an age, no Rabbit till Midſommer; And that in Two great reſpects.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, till that time they bear little grouth, and do not much harme if well looked too.</p>
                     <p>Secondly the wool and skin is then ſerviceable.</p>
                     <p>Now for Calves, the laws for rearing of yong Cattell muſt be made in
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:105181:111"/> them more certain; for Bull Calves needs not in many places to be preſerved equally as others; ſome alſo are plainly unfit for to be reared, at leaſt by opinion; Therefore there muſt be a looſe to them more then others.</p>
                     <p>But to ſetle all, to provide that every ſecond, third, fourth or fifth Calfe be reared up, or ſo much paid to the hayward of the Town; And every Town to have one, ſeems eaſie and feazible.</p>

                     <p>ASSuredly the taking of cuſtomes, &amp;c. engages the Supream Magiſtrate to the guard of the Sea; now this done, many think the work is done, and cuſtomes are due clearly; but the Subject muſt bear his private loſs.</p>
                     <p>Others Chriſtianlike ſay that there are providences which none can eſchew, and for theſe each one muſt bear his own burthen. Next there are remote places wherein Traffique is thought ſetled; Yet clearly in dominions of other Princes and States, and that for any Supream Magiſtrate to aſſure their Subjects in all places, is impoſſible. Therefore the Engagement of the Magiſtrate muſt be ſetled.</p>
                     <p>Firſt that the Piracy be within ſuch a precinct or bound.</p>
                     <p>Secondly that it be a veſſel of the Nation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly of goods lawful, but not that if any goods unlawful were in the Ship, no recompence be, but that recompence be only for lawful, that is not goods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, whether for importation or exportation.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly to a Subject of the Nation, in other caſes let the cuſtomes of Nations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</p>
                     <p>But in theſe caſes it is juſt that Recompence be to the looſers by the Supream Magiſtrate out of prizes taken by his men of War, which ought therefore to be valew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and returnes made Annually to the loſers as their loſſes are proved in time; allwaies provided a high puniſhment, bee to him or them abuſe the State.</p>
                     <p>Now there is great difficulty made of the proof of theſe things. But we perceive it is eaſie to the State if the Governors have a minde; for the lading will appear in the Bill or Cocket if they have it; if not, and</p>
                     <p>That that be miſcarried, they can have what they can claime out of the office from whence they ſailed; And the Principal Merchants can quickly make out the work; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if all Merchants be brought under rules of Trade as they ought to be, what ever is yet alledged to the Contrary.</p>

                     <head>In whom is the Right and Power of Calling Councels.</head>
                     <p>THis is a great Queſtion, much ado is made concerning it in the world, and yet all to little purpoſe; for that moſt ſpend their time onely in treating what was done; but few upon what right it was founded.</p>
                     <p>It is not, nor cannot be intended here, who ſhould Congregate the people in Civil Matters.</p>
                     <p>No, it is intended in Queſtions doubtful, troubling the peace of the Churches of God.</p>
                     <p>Now it is plain, by what hath been ſaid before, that the latitude of the Magiſtrates power in theſe caſes, is only the preſervation of the publick Peace; otherwiſe he hath but the relation of a private Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>Therefore as Emperour, King, or State, to ſettle, or convene a Colloque, Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, Dyet, or Councel, Provincial or General, he hath no Power in a Church-way.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be only prudentiall, to aſſure or continue the publick peace in the beſt way they may, wherein all things that are not unlawfull and be expedient, become lawful.</p>
                     <p>But to aſſure the jealouſie of the Supream power, it is not requiſite to have ſuch publick Conventions without the Magiſtrates permiſſion; but to turn this ſufferance into a Right, was an Error.</p>
                     <p>Again, for the Churches to deſire the Magiſtrates permiſſion, and after to enforce a Grant, or ſummon without, was a greater fault; for their profeſſion admits leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation; juſt Magiſtrates will not deny the Churches lawful meetings, while the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſeek but lawful things lawfully.</p>
                     <p>Now as the Churches have the firſt inſight, as by Office, into Church Errors, it is their duty to conſult a remedy; and if a meeting of ſome few Churches, yea be it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall, ſhall be required, till error ariſe, it may not be unlawfull; they have the Right.</p>
                     <p>But if the Magiſtrate upon error ſettle a Law to prevent that error, (further the Magiſtrate ought not to go, and ſo far he may) then the Churches ought to obſerve that Law; But in caſe of Error, or ſuch Conventions as are poſſibly dangerous to the Civil Peace, the Supream Magiſtrate ought to be adviſed, and ought to be obeyed, if diſſenting, yea though his diſſent be not in ſome eyes well grounded; for this evil is the leaſt, however experience hath manifeſted in a ſuperſtitious Age the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man prevailes, in a ſwording the Magiſtrate.</p>
                     <p>What I have written, may to many ſeem doubtful, to whom the power of Right belongs.</p>
                     <p>But the plain meaning is this; This being a Church-Affair, an Aſſembly for the ſettlement of conſcience, it is the proper work of the Churches.</p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:105181:112"/>
                     <p>And if the Churches have power over one the other, as in the Popiſh, Epiſcopal, and Presbyterian way; the Summons ought <hi>De jure</hi> to move from the Church, but the Magiſtrate may prohibit, and ought to be obeyed; but divers Churches diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this in fact, cauſed firſt an addreſs to the Imperial Power, and ſo it would do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; alſo the very Congregating ſuch Members into one place, ought, both for the ſafety of them that meete, and the place where they meete, and of the whole State, to be not onely with the knowledge, but the approbation of the Supream Magiſtrate; and the rather, for that though thoſe elected ought to go, yet no Chriſtian may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred; this in that way, and in the Congregational way more clearly will aſſure, that though the buſineſs be a Church buſineſs, and concerning matters of meer conſcience: yet the great matter, is, as they are men, to conſult of difficulties and this is the Church-work; and therefore the Magiſtrate ought not to preſcribe the Chriſtians met what to propound.</p>
                     <p>For I preſume, That ought to be long before manifeſted; firſt, in the private Congregation, then in the adjoyning Churches, yea, in publike Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>There is another part of the Quaere, that is, Whether the Magiſtrate may ſummon without the Churches prayer?</p>
                     <p>Now as to the right, aſſuredly as a Father of the Country principally intruſted for the good, welfare, and peace of his people, and as a Chriſtian taking notice of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Controverſies, he may invite aſſembling the Churches, and may require it, but ought not enforce untill the civil Peace be actually diſturbed; he leaves the ſin at their door. This root of bitterneſs aroſe from thoughts of the neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying what was amiſs, and venturing all for that, which is true and falſe: A falſe colour of truth with a real miſtake; the Magiſtrate cannot enforce here; the Church muſt have its due liberty here; otherwiſe we muſt admit by the Rule of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, the like power to the Church againſt the Magiſtrate offending.</p>
                     <p>No, let each keep their place, and if the Magiſtrate will amend the Church, let it be by Preaching, not fighting; let them come that will upon his call, let him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the other, not enforce actually (politickly he may) no not though all that come agree with him.</p>
                     <p>But I am confident, Take away the intereſt of Power and Revenue, and the Spring of all theſe controverſies will be dried up; for the matter is clear in it ſelf, and by moſt ſo agreed.</p>
                     <p>I could enlarge much in this, and all the heads that I have treated on.</p>
                     <p>I could have multiplied Quaeries to delight the Ear, and make the Book more Merchantable in this Age; I could have ſcattered witty varieties, Recorded old Hiſtories, and enterwoven new Stories, to have delighted a foeminine fancy; I could have ſo poliſhed my phraſe, and trimmed my diſcourſe, that it ſhould have ſtoln a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the heart of a light youngling, and like a <hi>Romance</hi> fettered him in a clew of delights, till he had come to the end of the Book and been never the wiſer.</p>
                     <p>But as the firſt thing moved me to this Work, was the ſerious apprehenſion of the bitter Cup the Lord had put into the hand of the Inhabitants of this Nation to drink, and what God had done in <hi>Germany;</hi> when my ſoul conſidered the deadly defiances among men ſo called Chriſtians; not onely Nation againſt Nation, but they of the ſame Nation one againſt the other:</p>
                     <p>When I eyed the Threats and Promiſes of the Word of the Eternal God, Revolved his Acts of old, and at preſent done amongſt us; comparing the Profeſſions and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes of Chriſtians; and that though we had light above others, yet our ſins were more grievous then others; but moſt of all was my ſpirit affected with the many engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which lay upon the Nation; For this light drew from us on all ſides, Royal, and Parliamentary, and that under what notion, or name, or opinion ſoever you will rank them, Promiſes and Vows of ſetling Truth and Righteouſneſs; King, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and People, all ſeeing the Errors in Church and State; a bare name, no face, if a footſtep of pure Chriſtianity. This in the firſt place put me upon a more ſerious way of Writing; and in the ſecond place, the multitude of my occaſions would not permit the idle time to clip, and pare, and file, when I was forced to ſteal time, to caſt and mould the matter of this Diſcourſe by a quarter of the hour to day, and as
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:105181:112"/> much the next, ſeldom an hour together, and then happily not of a week, two, or three, ſometimes not of a moneth after; This will render me to a wiſe man over zealous, and over-confident, to ruſh ſo unadviſedly into ſuch a great undertaking as it doth attempt the holding forth, though but in Eſſay, the frame of a Civil Chriſtian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and they that know me will ſay,</p>
                     <p>Have ſo many Ages paſſed? Are ſo many wiſe men at preſent? And none to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it, but one ſo young, a man not able for time to have digeſted in any part the voluminous Tracts, which he that but offers at ſuch an Eſſay ought to have gone through; and to do all this <hi>raptim,</hi> and that by ſnatches, which required the moſt ſerious thoughts.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, A man that practiſed the Law of <hi>England</hi> ſo ſhort a while, that he could not comprehend the Ambages of it; and for eminency of parts, a man of no Renown, the world hath not taken notice of him.</p>
                     <p>I know this, as to others, will be the whiſpers and ſpeakings concerning Me, and this Work; It is not preſumption of my Abilities, nor to gain applauſe that I adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon this Work; my heart was fired within me, when after ſo many reiterated undertakings for Righteouſneſs, Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſaw the VVork ſo far off from perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that it was worſe then before.</p>
                     <p>I waited, attended, hoped, prayed, and all, yea incited men able, and skilled in the Laws of the Land, by long ſtudy, and approved parts: They agreed Error in the whole, a neceſſity of Reformation, and that even by a Tranſubſtantiation not Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation; for they agreed the whole Law was, as it is, devolved into Form and Practiſe; the pure ſtreams of Juſtice, were as they fell from the fountain of Divine and Moral Reaſon, drawn by Art into private Ciſterns of Profit and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                     <p>But they durſt not undertake the VVork.</p>
                     <p>I deſired then, conſidering my many occaſions, That they would but impart ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to me, to help me in my ſo great attempt; I talked with ſome Attorneys to the ſame purpoſe; and from two men I received two Papers, ſhewing the abuſe of dammage clear and ſuing out the <hi>Cap. utlagats,</hi> the moſt ordinary matters.</p>
                     <p>I then addreſſed my ſelf to ſome men eminent in Honor, and places of Truſt; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered my minde; we argued; I ſaw they were convinced of the truth of the thing, and were reſolved, were the Law altered, they ſhould ſubmit, yea even to what I then and here propounded.</p>
                     <p>But they would have no hand in it; they had no time, they had ſpent their Studies in the preſent Law, and to change was a new work; Some adviſed me to leave off theſe thoughts, and fall to Practiſe, they would warrant me I ſhould get as much as any of them; After long delayes, conſulting my own ſtrength, and ſeeing Judges, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants, Councellors, Attorneys, Solicitors, and All, confeſſed Alteration neceſſary, delayes evident, Juſtice incertain, Equity more ruining then undoing Common Law.</p>
                     <p>I did partly out of the ſence of the unjuſtneſs and wickedneſs of the Law, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally that I might be out of the laſh of a credit Ruining frown, leave all Practiſe whatſoever, as I had formerly left the moſt, and did conſult which way to take to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the moſt Chriſtian way, the Evils of the Apoſtate State, and Commonwealth; and how to offer an expedient ſutable to the condition of the people wedded to Laws and Cuſtoms called their own.</p>
                     <p>This is that which the Lord put me upon; I have avoided to my utmoſt all bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and juſt occaſion of offence to any, either Powers, or perſons: And to any man ſhall require a further account of the hope that is in me concerning matter of Conſcience, or of the matter of Law, and the Reaſons herein offered, ſo it be with Chriſtian meekneſs and zeal for the Truth, according to my knowledge, I ſhall freely diſcover my ſelf, and yield I hope, a ſatisfactory anſwer.</p>
                     <p>For I aſſert, there is nothing here laid down in any kind, as to the civil Regiment, not warranted by the preſent (ſo called) Law-books of <hi>England;</hi> I reſtrain not my ſelf to the ſo called Year-Books.</p>
                     <p>For the ſcantneſs of my time, I could have wiſhed more, and more abilities, and that both natural and experimental; but you muſt take it as it is; onely an Eſſay for a
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:105181:113"/> Settlement of a Chriſtian Commonwealth, I leave the Work to ſuch as Providence ſhall cull out of the many preſent Worthies of <hi>Englands</hi> Labourers.</p>
                     <p>Me thinks, <hi>England</hi> labours like a woman in ſore pangs of Travel, crying out to be delivered; I pray God none of the Midwives <hi>Juno</hi> like ſet croſs-legg'd in the Temple of honor, profit, power, or the like. O that every one could baniſh all intereſts, and all Relatious for Chriſts ſake.</p>
                     <p>I know abundance that will allow this project of Reſolving this Nation into Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Juriſdictions, their ſpirits will be immediatly fancying places to themſelves, friends, kindred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the moddle holds forth a due ſatisfaction, even to carnal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts.</p>
                     <p>The oppoſition will ariſe from the great intereſt of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Supream Judicatures; but it is clear, their intereſt may thus be continued to a juſt proportion.</p>
                     <p>Now they ruine Government within themſelves, and deſtroy the whole Nation beſides; let them live, but let not <hi>England</hi> periſh; for the Lords ſake, you that are our Phyſitians, remember your promiſes when you undertook the Cure.</p>
                     <p>Then you ſtroaked the wound gently, you asked nothing till the cure were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; but our wound is open ſtill, more wayes to diſcourage the poor impoveriſhed ſubject then ever.</p>
                     <p>Take but the many fruitleſs Acts for poor priſoners into conſideration, and the forceing an <hi>Affidavit</hi> of the Engagement, notwithſtanding a Certificate of the Commiſſioners; can we not eaſily determine the Reaſon? it cannot be zeal for Juſtice, but the Clerks Fee upon the Oath; our hearts are hot in purſuit after the world, while our lips breath forth expreſſions of the new birth.</p>
                     <p>Aſſuredly <hi>Englands</hi> Allarms to War will not ceaſe till the ſins ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>You that are in Authority, like valiant Chieftains, muſt not onely ſpeak couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, but Act rigorouſly; you and your juſt Acts and Ordinances are ſlighted, and contemned; Firſt, by your ſelves, our Truſtees, they are not duly tranſmitted to the Counties; then by our ſelves, your Truſtees, they, or ſome of them deal with them as they liſt, each one interprets as his intereſt leads.</p>
                     <p>Let theſe things be repreſented to you, and what is done? nothing.</p>
                     <p>Nay, come up to <hi>London,</hi> waite and attend till you be weary; the juſtneſs of your Cauſe gives not the quicker diſpatch; yea, I have heard, that ſome ſpoken to, to haſten matters agreed on, have been told their haſte ſhould cauſe their tarriance, or words to that effect.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are ſad Symptoms, to ſuch Melancholy ſpirits as mine, of renewed Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; I ſhall ſay no more, But leaving the whole Work to the Lord, addreſs my ſelf to ſeek his face, and pray unto

To Preach Love, and live in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; to Preach Obedience and be Refractory, if not Rebellious, is not Chriſts way.</p>
                              <p>O let them all ſee, even from the higheſt to the loweſt; that its Error evident hath cauſed Truth to be diſtruſted, and their words contemned; Righteouſneſs and Truth carry a Majeſty which Satan fears: Convince them therefore, that as they have loſt the glory of Paſtors, by preaching Chriſt, and pretending for Chriſt, and following the world, and ſeeking Self, ſo they muſt redeem their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient honor by ſignal ſervices.</p>
                              <p>Let love be even to Enemies, and let the reducing of thoſe that go aſtray, be with that real ſincere affection, as they Preach Saint Iohn did his back-ſliding outlaw, given in truſt to a Paſtor or Biſhop.</p>

                              <p>Holy Father, give us Magiſtrates as of old, men full of wiſdom, and of the fear of the Lord, men of courage, and deſpiſing riches: let them make Thee their ſtrength, not truſting to their knowledge, knowing that in caſe of a Kingdom appointed to ruine by God, wiſe Councels and fair occaſions avail not, but are by a ſecret over-ruling Providence wholly inverted: nor to their courage riches or power for the ſame reaſons.</p>
