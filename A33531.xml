            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Power of the Almighty hath vi≈øibly appeared here the≈øe many years, ≈øcattering of Truths, and revealing hard ≈øayings, and giving to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand things that were hid for many Generations, though according to the wi≈ødom of the Father he hath di≈øpen≈øed divers gifts, and that there is much of controver≈øie among us; yet if all be really for Chri≈øt, and the increa≈øe of his Kingdom, what matters it? Let but all this move and incourage each in his place faithfully to labour in the Vineyard of the Lord. The Ma≈øter is expected; how he will come, lets not wrangle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, nor with whom: Let's all high and low, as we profe≈øs to expect his coming, ≈øo prepare for it: A≈ø≈øuredly he will then come to us in his glory, or take us to his glory: Therefore all you that in ≈øincerity profe≈øs Chri≈øtianity, rowze up your ≈øelves, li≈øten to the call of the Lord; He hath call'd afar off in <hi>Germany,</hi> he hath call'd at home, both here and in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> hear his voyce, prepare to meet the Lord your glory. Hitherto Chri≈øtians have been the ≈øhame of Chri≈øtianity, and Go≈øpellers the ≈øcandal of the Go≈øpel. There was a fatall and general Apo≈øtacy faln upon her who called her ≈øelf the Spou≈øe of Chri≈øt; ≈øhe as <hi>Aholah</hi> &amp; <hi>Aho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libah</hi> played the Harlot; and though ≈øhe here with us in <hi>England</hi> promi≈øed to return, yet ≈øhe kept her Darlings ≈øtill; if ≈øhe parted with the <hi>A≈ø≈øyrian</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:105181:3"/> Adulterer, ≈øhe kept the <hi>Syrian;</hi> God will have no mixture with Idols: <hi>England</hi> hath long de≈øired a thorow Reformation: Let no man boggle at the work if another de≈øires more then as ≈øome of you did 20. or 30. years ≈øince: why may not God have revealed this to him, and clo≈øed thine eyes now, as well as he revealed his will formerly to thee, and ≈øhut the eyes of others. Heretofore God put mean men only upon the work, here and there one; now he hath put many and great men upon the work; and what ever ≈øpurs they have; yet Chri≈øtian, if they drive on Gods de≈øign, lay thy hand on thy mouth, and only admire how God brings things to pa≈øs what he intends.</p>
                  <p>Some men are ≈øo rational, they can ≈øee nothing of providence; rea≈øon devours Religion, and they are afraid le≈øt they ≈øhould happily find, or be found of God in a way they expected not; they wholly tru≈øt to rea≈øon, and will ≈øee and feel, or they will not beleeve.</p>
                  <p>Others are meerly ≈øen≈øual, and in the muddine≈øs of their temper fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ≈øen≈øe only, becau≈øe rea≈øon is ≈øo various; as many opinions as men even in things not above us; This is the main <hi>ba≈øis</hi> of Athei≈øme; ≈øhun this <hi>Scylla</hi> and that <hi>Charybdis,</hi> and under≈øtand, All Gods wayes are not only prudential, but providential, and God a≈ø≈øuredly ≈øpeaks both ways: He that improves providence to Lu≈øt, Error, and Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion again≈øt the evident revealed will of God, is like him that becau≈øe he hears of Election, ≈øins at liberty, which is a mark of Rejection; He that in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things in ≈øtreights for God, his glory, his Truth and Laws, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Righteou≈øne≈øs, in ≈øimplicity eyes God with con≈øtant and fervent prayers, walking humbly and watchfully over him≈øelf, and all that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with him, ≈øpying what leads and mi≈øleads, and ≈øearching all inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øts, ca≈øts all away all but that of the Lord and his Righteou≈øne≈øs: Surely he is like him that hearing of Election, and not knowing who it is, yet beleeving not only the truth of it, but ble≈ø≈øings appertaining to it, ≈øaith, I will ≈øeek if happily I may find, I will knock becau≈øe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe; and ≈øuch are a≈ø≈øured to enter life eternal.</p>
                  <p>Now all you that have in your eye the expectation of the glorious appearance of the Lord Chri≈øt in your ≈øeveral ≈øtations, Parliament, Princes and Nobles, Army, Judges, Officers, Magi≈øtrates, Rich men, Citizens, high and low, Rich and poor, one with another, de≈øpi≈øe not my weakne≈øs, inability, unworthine≈øs; eye not my life pa≈øt or pre≈øent, but look to what I ≈øay, and as you find it bearing the mark and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of fervent truth, accept it; if you doubt, labor ≈øatisfaction private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; if you ≈øpy an error, rebuke or inform me with Chri≈øtian wi≈ødom and ≈øobriety (my zeal for Gods cau≈øe, not ≈øelf-confidence, hath put me forth to the work) and I ≈øhall willingly learn, and ble≈øs-God that makes me know his will, yea though by my failings, ≈øo it may work to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe of his glory, and propagation of truth. <hi>Amen,</hi> So be it.</p>
                  <p>And fir≈øt give me leave to ≈øpeak a word to you that have at pre≈øent the Supremacy of Power, lay to heart the≈øe things: Fir≈øt, that you are in Gods ≈øtead; Next that there are many vows upon the Nation for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice and Righteou≈øne≈øs, again≈øt the then, and ≈øtill continued unchri≈øtian, uncivil, nay inhumane dealings of man with man, as man with <hi>God,</hi> &amp;c. You ≈øtand in the eys of all, all your goings are marked, and all your fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings graven to Record: Publick nece≈ø≈øities, your own con≈øciences and
<pb facs="tcp:105181:3"/> peoples complaints, have plucked forth Declarations to men, as well as Covenants to God; the Obligations to men are ≈øtill the ≈øame, if the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon be the ≈øame: And for our Obligations wherein we lift up our hands to the mo≈øt high God; truly though the Covenant (as is ≈øaid) be out of date, that is the end of the Covenant for ≈øatisfaction to the King, to draw him to an union and conjunction with his great Councel, be di≈øobliged; yet the ≈øeeking of the ≈øetling of this Nation, the three Nations, all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, according to the Rule of Righteou≈øne≈øs in love, peace, and unity, yea the drawing of them to uniformity, both in Doctrine and Di≈øcipline according to the Word of God (that is, by the evidence of truth and the manife≈øtation of the Spirit) is ≈øtill the duty of all Chri≈øtians; for this had been a duty, had the Covenant never have been; it was before it, and mu≈øt remain after.</p>
                  <p>The pre≈øent Age is in the learned part very acute, at lea≈øt to cen≈øure all per≈øons, and then a≈ø≈øuredly the actions of Enemies. You have many who foment jealou≈øies from the ≈øuppo≈øed Errings and delays, ≈øome to one end, ≈øome to another, but all of beleeving the old experimented Rule of the de≈øtructivene≈øs of popular Government from the variety and incon≈øtancy, the dilatorine≈øs and ambiguou≈øne≈øs of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and un≈øatisfiedne≈øs of ≈øo many ≈øelfi≈øh Intere≈øts as are among them; this is to bring in the Government of a King again; Indeed multitude of occa≈øions makes your proceedings ≈ølow-paced. In≈øtead of particular Acts which are un≈øatisfactory, ≈øettle a compleat body of Government; you have means of ≈øupplying all indigencies; for if you improve your power to evident publick good, who will oppo≈øe? The Royali≈øt and all among the Parliament party agree in many ju≈øt things, yet uneffected: Ju≈øtice is the pre≈øervation as foundation of the Throne. If you will raign ≈øafely, walk not in any of the wayes of them that fell before you; the pre≈øident of their puni≈øhment, as their error is too nigh at hand: Let no intere≈øt deterr you from your Rule: Con≈øerve indeed the real Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the people, free us from all tho≈øe Legerdemains, the ≈øleights of Oppre≈ø≈øion and Tyranny: What was unju≈øt gain in the King, let not the State demand there; depend upon, &amp; follow providence as far as you will, and be as remi≈øs and ≈øo called merciful as you plea≈øe; but in things ju≈øt and evidently conducing to common good be ≈øevere and unalterable; this is righteous: In things difficult and doubtful, fir≈øt u≈øe rea≈øon and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, di≈øcover the intere≈øt oppo≈øing, and ≈øo proceed to afflict; this wil breed both fear and love: Alter a good and ju≈øt thing, though to a more ju≈øt, by degrees, and gently; for intere≈øts have here lawful pleas; but in evidently evil, it's the glory to make ≈øpeed: Connive not there for an hour. What is here driven at, is the ju≈øt Reformation of all our Laws, the Reduction of them to a Rule and ≈øtandard of Chri≈øtian Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity. You that are of the long Robe, both in and out of the hou≈øe, you who≈øe knowledge both divine and humane abounds, as your abilities in outward as inward excellencies, Judges, Councellors and Officers of all ≈øorts, look not at ancient Cu≈øtomes, but at the common Ju≈øtice of them; not how they re≈øtrain particular evils, but as they conduce to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øal good. If you will not admit the oppo≈øition of inferiors, do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but carrying that evidence of rea≈øon, as may ≈øtop the mouths of fools, as well as ≈øatisfie wi≈øe men: Let Godline≈øs now in this light be

To you Princes and Nobles, I ≈øay, learn by Gods dealings with you, to ≈øee Thrones, and Scepters, Powers Civil and Military, Riches and Honors, Wi≈ødom and all, are the gifts of the Almighty Wi≈ødom: The Hand of Providence holds them forth, and di≈øpo≈øeth them as it plea≈øeth: You have been bad Stewardes, amend your wayes; God hath here and there taken all away, otherwhere a great part, mo≈øt have ≈øuffered: know God is able yet to take away the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: ≈øeek not therefore in pa≈ø≈øion to break out; what ever you do carry God along with you, and that not in thought but deed; a≈ø≈øuredly the judgement el≈øe will be more ≈ømart, and deeper in every change, lets ≈øee the Work of God upon your hearts: change Profe≈ø≈øion into Practi≈øe of Chri≈øtianity; idolize not the Form, but acting ≈øincerely Zeal, Holine≈øs, Au≈øterity of Life in the avoiding the very appearances of evil, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary in Charity, and that not onely in giving much, but giving well; ordering the wayes not of your ≈øelves onely, but of your Families, ≈øo that the nobility of your ≈øouls in the excellence of graces may ≈øpeak you illu≈øtrious above ancient riches, the Vertues or Vices of your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors. The ≈øame I may ≈øay to the Gentry, and men of great e≈øtate, City and Country; know God gives you much that you may do much for him; wherein is now your excellency? Titles!

                  <p>I now ≈øhall ≈øpeak one word to the Army; You have followed Providence, make no Selfi≈øh Intere≈øt your Idol, le≈øt Providence for≈øake you; be a≈ø≈øured, others have many enemies; but for you, how few are your friends? there are great engagements upon you to God, who hath with ≈øuch a continued cour≈øe given ≈øucce≈øs to your undertakings: I am ≈øo far from incouraging to Mutinies as I condemn them; there are ju≈øt wayes; u≈øe them; I would draw all the world by the Clew of evident Rea≈øon and demon≈øtrative Ju≈øtice, much more Authorities; and when my rea≈øon could not prevail, I would at utmo≈øt lift up my voyce in prayer, with one hand and my heart, and hold my ≈øword in the other for my defence.

                  <p>I cannot but give out one word of advice to the great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent City of this Nation; you were ≈øen≈øible of evils pa≈øt, pride made you fat and you kicked with the heel: Though the greatne≈øs of Trade be broken, repine not; break not out, there is more lo≈øt in a day then can be gotten in a year; vex not Strangers from your Potency, nor Citizens by your Power: Petition not again≈øt Will in≈øtead of Law in others, and u≈øe far more irregularity, and upon le≈øs ground your ≈øelves: you heretofore gained the whole trading of the Nation into your company; we are all Engli≈øh men, ≈øhew us your Charter of Priviledge among≈øt the immunities of common Subjects: will you admit that a particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in your City ≈øhould of the Grant of the King have a priviledge to the detriment of your general Charter? why ≈øhould you then to the dammages of the whole Nation? Agree therefore to ju≈øt things; give God the glory to part with quietly from the convictions of ju≈øt Rea≈øon, what you might happily hold, either by Law or Power from your Grants, if the Grant be now evil, though not originally ≈øo; for Rea≈øon making things lawful, and being the bounds of Supream Monarches in general, it cannot be excluded their particular Grants: I know this will grate hard upon ≈øome among you; but if Chri≈øtians, they will hear; it were better to be le≈øs rich, and le≈øs populous, ≈øo more hone≈øt and better regulated: you are at pre≈øent, yea after ≈øo long ≈øitting under the Sword of the Vengeance of the Lord, the ≈øinke of abominable open prevailing ≈øins: you that ≈øhould be the Head to the Body, and the Eye to the Head in the greatne≈øs of Ble≈ø≈øings, going before others, and being a Pattern, and Example to all the re≈øt as a Mother City, as you have been ≈øtiled in the Nation; you are not active for that glorious Regiment of divine Rea≈øon, which as Chri≈øtian, is held forth to us in the Old and New Te≈øtament of our Lord and Saviour, the Lord Chri≈øt Je≈øus: you labour not in what is e≈øtabli≈øhed by Law; then ≈øure it can be little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that you ≈øhould endeavor the Settlement of more: it is a work of difficulty; the oppo≈øition of the world will be; but the world is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and this gives hopes of Conque≈øt, when we fight an Enemy that hath been beaten; its the cour≈øe of the world to plead Pre≈øidents, and then the highe≈øt are the be≈øt: you are able, do the work; you have done much in ≈øettling a Magi≈øtracie in Chief; ≈øet to the de≈øign; this is of intere≈øt publike; but cea≈øe not here; fit them to the general end of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as well as to the particular one of Opinion: Its the way of all Corporations; this may not be evil in Politicks; but there is a better in States, much more in Chri≈øtianity.</p>

Thus the poor and mi≈øerable people are daily utterly undone from Forms of Law, and the priviledge is in the Form. O Engli≈øhmen! deceive not your ≈øelves and others with ≈øhadows: The≈øe (≈øo (more then) evident) errings, wandrings, failings, and unrea≈øonable, unju≈øt proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures of ≈øo called (and proud of (as ≈øtriving for the) name of be≈øt, pure≈øt, holie≈øt, &amp;c.)

                  <p>I cannot ≈øee any ground why any ≈øhould be led away after them, nor give any credit to their ≈øayings; No, I rather believe it to be the malice of the enemy, ≈øubtil to deceive; they generally drive at two things, Community, and Parity; the one again≈øt the Tyranny and Oppre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. of great men in power; the other again≈øt the covetize, ≈øelfi≈øhne≈øs, luxuriou≈øne≈øs, &amp;c. of rich men.</p>

                  <p>Now the≈øe things, O you great and rich men, do mo≈øt a≈ø≈øuredly, as you rightly conceive, tend to mutiny, to nouri≈øh feuds and envyings betwixt the multitude and you.

                  <p>Con≈øider therefore what you have to do; God hath ≈øet all the≈øe as ≈øigns and tokens to you; if you fall, the evil is of your ≈øelves, your improvidencies, lightne≈ø≈øes, and in≈øtabilities; your odd and incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain followings of providences, evidence your fears, tho≈øe your doubts, tho≈øe the error of your principle; all things work contrary. O that every intere≈øt now could lay it ≈øelf down at the foot of Je≈øus, and ≈øay, I part with all for thee, and then take up all it hath as from him, and of his gift, and be ready to part with it to morrow: Should we then live as we do now? How many would then give to the poor to day, le≈øt they ≈øhould have nothing to give to morrow? How would they then not delight in luxurious Apparel, Hou≈øhold≈øtuff, &amp;c. wherein multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of riches lie dead and buried, le≈øt another ≈øhould enjoy them to morrow?</p>
                  <p>I know this to ≈øome melancholy ≈øpirit may give occa≈øion to think I aim at, or give too great footing to Community and Parity; for they ≈øhould in ≈øuch contemplations ca≈øt away all; but I ≈øpeak to the ≈øetled Chri≈øtian, who knows its lawful to u≈øe the world, but all in due order; and as its lawful to recreate, but ≈øpend more time in prayer, then in play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ≈øo its lawful to rejoyce in (and to have that we may rejoyce in) outward ble≈ø≈øings, but glorifie God with a greater portion to the poor then thy ≈øuperfluity amounts to.</p>
                  <p>I intend a due and ju≈øt reproof to exce≈øs and prodigality; Keep not all hor≈øes and doggs, ≈øome poor, not all in cloathing thy ≈øelf, ≈øome to the naked, and thy ≈øelf with moderacy; and yet if thou do≈øt the≈øe things, thou merite≈øt not Heaven, but thou avoide≈øt the ≈øcandal of men.</p>
                  <p>Now that this is not done, is the fault of the Magi≈øtrate: O Watchman! its thy duty, but thou ≈øette≈øt up for favor and by-re≈øpect, lazie, idle, and ignorant, and ≈øome evil Watchmen; therefore the work is not done; and that thou mighe≈øt tru≈øt the≈øe, thou made≈øt thy Law to extend to each matter, or ≈øo intende≈øt: and this was for two rea≈øons, one that fools, or any might not err, for the Letter was their guide; the other, that they that would abu≈øe their power, might not; and by this, not having each week a new Law, as occa≈øion grew, Ju≈øtice and Government is lo≈øt; for act by the≈øe particular Laws who can, in one hundred thou≈øand things ju≈øtly requiring remedy? The poor are thus ≈øold for le≈øs then a pair of old ≈øhooes. If you would give a remedy to this, authorize ≈øome few, or many, who ≈øhall examine and determine all actions by, or again≈øt any per≈øon not worth an hundred pounds; for no Tryal

                  <p>And now I come to ≈øpeak one word to the people; You are of many ≈øorts, and many intere≈øts you have; but as I find the wor≈øt and wickede≈øt, as educated, profe≈ø≈øing Chri≈øtianity, I advi≈øe you fir≈øt to labour as ≈øuch, to approve your ≈øelves: you have, its probable, been mo≈øt of you Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; the Covenant is indelible after once you have (I ≈øay not been Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, or Baptized with the Spirit) but owned that Covenant, in the name Bapti≈øm; you are a debtor to the Lord Chri≈øt of all the duties of the Go≈øpel.</p>
                  <p>This then, O poor Chri≈øtian, goes far; its the Magi≈øtrates duty to rule well; ≈øo 'tis thine to obey well: 'Tis the ≈øame with you as with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Chri≈øts time, when the great and powerful men ≈øpeak the Law, and hold forth duties of Righteou≈øne≈øs; do as they ≈øay, however they do; Its the Magi≈øtrates duty to hear and receive in a right way ju≈øt things from you; and by the implicite Rea≈øon of power onely to vote them unrea≈øonable and ≈øcandalous, is un≈øatisfactory; but if they do ≈øo, remain you in your integrity; break not out again≈øt them, untill the Lord ≈øhall open a way, he will do it in his due time; go on and ≈øatisfie thy ≈øoul in thy own righteou≈øne≈øs, I ≈øay ≈øo, Comfort thy ≈øelf in the mercy of thy God, who hath given thee to ≈øee others failings; and though thy condition be poor and needy, yet break not out: This I ≈øay of this great ≈øcarcity which hath faln upon us, wherein I believe many have peri≈øhed, yet the evil hath light on the rude, ≈øtubborn, di≈øordered poor, again≈øt whom mens bowels have been ≈øhut up; walk therefore according to the condition wherein God hath ≈øet you; exalt not your ≈øelves again≈øt great men, no nor again≈øt rich men, they will be too mighty for you; poor and proud is a high judgement, it brings mi≈øery with rejoycing. I know many of your ≈øouls die within you, when you ≈øee the wicked full, their eyes ≈øtare with fat; you wait upon God, and your children fami≈øh: yea many hence think God regardle≈øs, ≈øo unju≈øt at fir≈øt, at la≈øt deny him.

                  <p>And now one word to the Teachers of the people; Take heed to your ≈øelves, le≈øt while you preach to others, your ≈øelves become not ca≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awayes: Some of you call your ≈øelves ≈øtill the Clergy, I pray evidence by what ≈øpecial right or title: next you claim ≈øpecial Ordination; pray agree to what end; we are jealous of a many among you that would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro≈øs all knowledge of the Go≈øpel by as gainful a Trade as others did and do the Law; Briefly thus, If you have an infallible Word, ≈øhew it; if but a humane, and that that be attainable meerly or more e≈øpecially by Learning, and that by di≈øqui≈øition knowledge ≈øhal encrea≈øe, then ≈øhew how parts and graces are di≈øtingui≈øhable, and whether you wil quench the ≈øpirit altogether, or allow it altogether, or what or how; tel me why a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a member of the congregation, by them approved, may not improve his Talent to the edifying of his Brethren, as well as a Batchelor of Art, or Ma≈øter before ordained as you call it, Common Place as you call it, and that often more ≈øorily then an hone≈øt Bibling brother that never came at the Colledges, though at the Schools of the Prophets.</p>
                  <p>I cannot di≈øallow Pa≈øtoral de≈øignation, and ≈øo in order from Pa≈øtoral or Teaching abilities; but to re≈øt in de≈øignation any more then in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is incongruous; I know this opens a gap to fears of maintenance, but I ≈øee none ju≈øtly; I pray God your ≈øtanding off open not wider ones.

Its evidently ea≈øie to ≈øettle a Nation more numerous, more di≈øordered from ignorance and will, then this is; in the time we are di≈øcour≈øing how far the Magi≈øtrates power extends in Religious things, or in a Politick con≈øideration what ≈øhall be done when the Nation is ≈øetled, before the ≈øettlement be made or agreed upon; let's not to avoid the evils of the wor≈øt of Levelling ≈øo called, give advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to their de≈øigns or propo≈øals: Let's walk, ≈øo that we may by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon as well as power maintain our proceedings; before we undertake, lets re≈øolve to pro≈øecute or ≈øurcea≈øe upon evident and publick rea≈øon; the want of this hath di≈øobliged more then ever the Covenant or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement bound. And as I begun with you in Supream Power, Civil, or Military, or both, ≈øo give me leave to end; when you fir≈øt engaged, when fir≈øt you began this great work of Religion and Publick Liberty, how hot and ≈øpirituous were you, when great oppo≈øitions and many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigns were on foot? how watchful, when you were running for the Goale and ≈øtriving for the Ma≈øtery, yea, as your ≈øelves ≈øaid, venturing for your own Lives and Liberties? how regardle≈øs of bare forms? how then could you look at publick good in the nighe≈øt ≈øafe≈øt way? you could then lay out your way be≈øides the common Road without the formality of ≈øuing out an <hi>Ad quod damnum;</hi> yea what ≈øtrength of rea≈øon could not untye, the Sword did cut: Thus are the burthens, ≈ønares and vexations of truly religious people gone as to the con≈øcience: Thus far you have been ≈øincere in your Obligations to God; be al≈øo as faithful in your Tru≈øts to the Nation. I would not have Judges taken away, root and branch; Judges are found in Holy Writ, yea ≈øuch in power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as we de≈øire to have; we de≈øire Ju≈øtice ≈øhould flow like ≈øtreams, and Righteou≈øne≈øs like mighty waters; the want of this impoveri≈øhes the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I am in ≈øuch place, that I ≈øee and know it, yea I beleeve, let it be rightly ≈øcanned, it will appear mo≈øt co≈øtly, more ruinous, and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølaving then two ≈øuch Armies; and as now practi≈øed, more intolerable then an univer≈øal Toleration ≈øo often charged upon you.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lord God of hearts lay what is written to all your hearts, and grant that you may go on as you have promi≈øed, namely, according to the great Tru≈øt that is upon you from the people, you proceed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
<pb facs="tcp:105181:7"/> common good, (which is the true and ultimate end of all ju≈øt Government) and by a right aim at that, direct all your actions, and not cea≈øe to improve your be≈øt judgements, and lay out your mo≈øt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied labours, notwith≈øtanding all di≈øcouragements, either from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, envy, danger, or any other cau≈øe what≈øoever, to promote the ≈øame, ≈øo far, and ≈øo fa≈øt, as the ≈øubject matter will bear; and a≈ø≈øuredly the ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øings of Heaven will attend and follow you and your Councels; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe be a≈ø≈øured, when God hath made u≈øe of you for a while, the Lord will ca≈øt you away, as others before you, and your place ≈øhall no more be found: for the averting of which judgement, and ≈øetling this Nation and the Government of quiet and peace upon the foundation of Truth and Righteou≈øne≈øs, is the prayer of</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lord God for his own glory, and the accompli≈øhment of his determinate Councels, made the world, and every living thing, whether Angels, or men, in heaven or in earth; which perfected, The Almighty wi≈ødome, though it could have otherwaies glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it ≈øelf, thought fit among all the Creatures which his hands had made, to rai≈øe man to that pitch of honor, as to make him not only the object of his love, but in ≈øome ≈øort the Author of his honor, (who is the fountain it ≈øelf or original ≈øpring of honor and all other vertues and excellencies) and this he him≈øelf acknowledges, by ≈øeveral expre≈ø≈øions of his own, and Prophets, when men have yielded obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, ≈øaying they honored him, or gave glory to him. Yea indeed it will be acknowledged of all ≈øorts of men, that the end of mans Creation was (as is the work of every Artificer) the glory and honor of the Creator, and maker; Therefore the ≈øame wi≈ødom that Created man, even while man was yet ≈øimple and pure, in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute height of his fir≈øt created perfection, put him under the obedience of a Law and Rule in word, to the keeping of which tho≈øe fir≈øt principles which we call the Laws of ≈øen≈øe, and rea≈øon, were but ≈øub≈øervient. But man kept not long that ≈øtation; but di≈øobeyed the law of his mo≈øt high Creator, by which error or fall its concluded and agreed, by all Chri≈øtians, that the whole nature of man was corrupted and tainted, and from being the ≈øons of God in pure creation, all mankind became the ≈øons of <hi>Adam</hi> by natural propagation; bearing in our bodies the ≈øting and marks of our fir≈øt ≈øin, in our daily and continued tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions, thru≈øt out from the pre≈øence of our God, and could dwell no longer in paradi≈øe. And now the Laws of ≈øen≈øe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon were mans rule, God not holding that lively communion with man, which he did before, to pre≈øcribe him particular and po≈øitive Commands, or Laws; (at lea≈øt that we read of.) Yet the goodne≈øs of our Creator, tran≈øcendently appeared, in that while he breathes forth threatnings to his di≈øobedient ≈øervant, nay actually puni≈øhes him, in ejecting him the earthly Paradi≈øe, the Type of the heavenly Re≈øt, he opens a door of comfort, in ≈øo ≈øweet promi≈øes as he there annexed, of the hopes of a Saviour; under which Covenant he plea≈øed in all ages to take a ≈øpecial regard to ≈øome men, in and by whom the family and hou≈øhold of God was continued; and to the≈øe he ≈øeveral times, and by ≈øeveral manners revealed him≈øelf (whether by Dreams, Vi≈øions, Angels, or otherwi≈øe, is not ≈øo materiall to be here di≈øcu≈øt) and taught them the Laws and Ordinances of his hou≈øe, which Laws we ≈øee were not ≈øo contrary to the Law of pure Rea≈øon or the inherent law of nature, that they wrought divi≈øion, or ≈øeparation either among≈øt them≈øelves, or with others, or ≈øo per≈øpicuous to the eye of mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, that each wanderer ≈øaw the wi≈ødom of the Father, and immediately followed that rule and dictate of the divine Spirit; of which families or hou≈øholds it is conceived the Lord had ≈øeveral in divers Countries at the ≈øame time; but as being lea≈øt que≈øtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105181:12"/> mo≈øt proper to a Chri≈øtian, and ≈øo mo≈øt ≈øub≈øervient to our end, we ≈øhall only look at the direct line of ≈øcriptural genealogy, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> and ≈øo to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> of who≈øe po≈øterity in the twelve Patriarcks, was found the people of God, the holy ≈øeed, among whom were (in his due time) ≈øhewn the Oracles of God, the depth of wi≈ødom, both for the government of Gods people as men, or Saints, by the Lords annointed, and every inferior power under the civill Scepter: or by the royall Prei≈øthood or inferior <hi>Levite</hi> under the Divine declaration. How far <hi>Adams</hi> power extended, or how ab≈øolute it was, I ≈øhall not controvert, nor yet <hi>Noahs;</hi> but this we may ≈øee, that it was ≈øo paternal, that we read not of any cen≈øure that he gave to <hi>Cain</hi> upon his brothers murther; though we ≈øee God did; but how it was effected, whether only by the voice of con≈øcience, or otherwaies, is ≈øo difficult that we will not gue≈øs, but conclude, had the knowledge of it been material, either for Gods honor or our good, the holy and wi≈øe God would not have ≈øo ob≈øcured it; nor yet gives God a precept again≈øt murder, but gives it <hi>Noah</hi> after the Flood. That it was want of ab≈øolute power afterwards, that brought ≈øuch loo≈øne≈øs, and di≈øorders upon the world whereby ≈øin in the ≈øucce≈ø≈øions of generations, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> was ≈øo multiplyed, the contrary ≈øeems evident, and that from the Tenor of Gods truth: For there were mighty men, who abu≈øed their power to wrong and inju≈øtice, therefore were they plagued; we may ≈øay plainly, they ≈øought and got power over each other, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed the pure law of nature: For (though I am not again≈øt, nay I am for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as will well appear hereafter, yet) this I ≈øay, that the law of pure naturals ≈øets not one above another, which law ob≈øerved, there would be no need of Governors, for each one would be a law unto him≈øelf: But to return, the power thus obtained, they abu≈øed it to unju≈øt ends, Spoile, Robbery, Rapine, Lu≈øt, and ≈øuch like; for this came the wrath of God upon the≈øe children of di≈øobedience and violence; and the Flood wa≈øhed away them and their ≈øins together. Yet the Lord remembred <hi>Noah,</hi> for was he ju≈øt, from who≈øe po≈øterity de≈øcended all the pre≈øent Inhabitants of the earth; and although the fathers were, as <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> righteous in their generations; yet the ≈øons and progenie of the≈øe, forgat the laws of their fathers hou≈øe, and fell into the delu≈øions of <hi>Sathan,</hi> by the lu≈øts of their own hearts; And forgetting the Judgements of God upon the old world, they as well as the ≈øeed of <hi>Cham,</hi> fell into the ≈øins of the old world, and promoted them≈øelves over their brethren, not according to priority of birth, as mo≈øt congruous to rea≈øon, but by might and power, abu≈øing tho≈øe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent qualifications of divine infu≈øion, again≈øt the law of the mo≈øt High, and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their factions, they by ≈øtrength got dominion, which loth to lo≈øe, they combined together again≈øt God him≈øelf; nay as ≈øure as the Lord liveth, the Poet truly expre≈ø≈øeth the heart of man, The≈øe Giants or <hi>Principes</hi> would if they could, have pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God out of heaven; they fir≈øt brake his Laws, and then fought again≈øt him; but the Almighty now only ≈øcatters them to his glory; and they who before were bounded in a narrow compa≈øs, are now di≈øper≈øed through all regions, and it is concluded that the chief of them of one language, upon the confu≈øion of tongues was their Prince, but whether that were the mo≈øt Ancient, Strong, or Wi≈øe, we ≈øhall not need here di≈øpute; it is agreed there was a cheif, and that the mo≈øt ancient, by the general Law of rea≈øon, owned that place. However it is mo≈øt probable that their dominion extended not over many, or that their power was unlimited: But it ≈øeemeth among the ≈øons of <hi>Noah,</hi> that <hi>Chams</hi> po≈øterity fir≈øt deviated from the rule of nature, in <hi>Nimrod,</hi> who notwith≈øtanding he had elder brothers, yet took the power of government upon him; yet its conceived he went no further then the government of his own family, the heads of families appearing in the ≈øame age with him in the off≈øpring both of <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;</hi> and tis not probable that in tho≈øe times the government was mo≈øtly ≈øuch; for they might have enough in one family for one man well to govern, con≈øidering the many hundreds of years tho≈øe ancients lived, and the mind of man might well then be contented with it; the profit was care, and the honor duty, and the end only ≈øafety again≈øt bruti≈øh inva≈øion, which cour≈øe is as mo≈øt natural, ≈øo mo≈øt conjectural, untill the contrary be proved. And mo≈øt a≈ø≈øuredly as their families increa≈øed, even after the di≈øper≈øion, ≈øo divided they the land as well as in the dayes of <hi>Peleg;</hi> and though it may be conceived that in this di≈øper≈øion and confu≈øion of languages, the ≈øeed or occa≈øion of future Di≈øcords, Wars, Jars, and ≈øuch like was ≈øown, yet it is probable that the earth in the fulne≈øs thereof being before them, and the remembrance of kindred being fre≈øh,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105181:12"/> they did not immediately break out into blood, by forcing a di≈ø≈øei≈øing, or putting them out of po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions who were in; but tho≈øe unprovided ≈øought out habitations, and their numbers in their re≈øpective progre≈ø≈øes increa≈øing, they ≈øent out what we call Colonies: The chief leader or Colonel of which, was, as is mo≈øt likely, the mo≈øt Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, who al≈øo gave forth to them the general law of their fathers, whether traditional or otherwaies; and the next in degree of age, as the fathers of many children were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as chiefs, next that cheif, or King, and the≈øe by Scripture according to that phra≈øe in the time of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> writing (when now the world was grown to ≈øome ≈øetle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in di≈øordered order) were called Princes; But the≈øe ≈øoon wax out the remembrance of their neerne≈øs of blood (for ≈øurely where God was not regarded, man was neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) forgetting God and his Law, and private intere≈øt increa≈øing, the i≈ø≈øue was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, Wars and Jars. The ju≈øt might ≈øeparate and divide, as did holy <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ju≈øt <hi>Lot;</hi> but the wicked fought for it, and by power obtained their will, and that law or liberty of blood-letting once admitted, there was no ≈øtint of ≈øtrife, they renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Wars as the ≈øea≈øon of the year gave opportunity, and with this ≈øtrife out of all que≈øtion came in (again≈øt the law of nature) the ≈øervitude of man to man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with al≈øo a confu≈øion of families, as to pure di≈øcent. But let us pa≈øs on and ha≈øt, the Lord makes now his family in the hou≈øhold of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by e≈øpeciall Covenant of promi≈øe with him and his ≈øeed, rejecting all other Nations; Yet how that rejection wrought, is difficult: for <hi>Melchizedech, Abrahams</hi> contemporary was a holy man, and a≈ø≈øuredly kept purely the law of his fathers, ≈øuppo≈øed of <hi>Shem,</hi> though living among≈øt the accur≈øed Cananites; ≈øo <hi>Pharoah</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to whom the Lord communicated his error in taking <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife, and more e≈øpecially <hi>Abymelech</hi> King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> who apprehen≈øive of Gods indignation, for the ≈øame thing, prayeth as one, and that not only of him≈øelf, but as of a Nation that knew and kept the Covenant of the Lord, Wilt thou al≈øo de≈øtroy a righteous Nation, ≈øaid he not ≈øhe is my ≈øi≈øter? But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; This <hi>Abraham</hi> is called a mighty Prince, yet Arms but three hundred and eighteen, this confirms what was before a≈ø≈øerted, ≈øhewing what Kings and Princes then were, for the≈øe were to fight four Kings, and manife≈øtly proves the generality to be but heads of families (though the <hi>A≈ø≈øyrian</hi> had now conquered many families) mark al≈øo <hi>Abrahams</hi> complaint for lack of an heir, urging his power and e≈øtate to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to <hi>Eleazar</hi> his chief ≈øervant; The≈øe things are in≈øerted only to lead the weak rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a plain path way of hi≈øtoricall narration, therefore this one example might ≈øuffice, but this mu≈øt be more then ≈øeconded, both in <hi>I≈øaac</hi> the child of promi≈øe, and <hi>Jacob</hi> and his progeny; <hi>I≈øaac</hi> was <hi>Abrahams</hi> heir both of goods and graces, yet falls into the offence of <hi>Abraham</hi> his father, and for ≈øafeguard of his life denieth his wife; And as a King governing his family; hath i≈ø≈øue <hi>E≈øau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> Twins, and although the birth right of divine ble≈ø≈øing is by <hi>I≈øaac</hi> given to <hi>Jacob,</hi> yet the temporall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was to <hi>E≈øau,</hi> which primogeniture is ≈øeveral waies; and in the right of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to <hi>E≈øau,</hi> by <hi>Jacob,</hi> who≈øe ≈øub≈øtance was the gift of his God in, and for his faithfull ≈øervice he performed to <hi>Laban.</hi> But lets ha≈øt to ≈øee <hi>Jacob</hi> in his full grown family, di≈øcended into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and there continued the time appointed by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe, during who≈øe ≈øervitude, while the yoak of <hi>Pharoah</hi> gauled the necks of his off-≈øpring, (the way which God u≈øed to perform and fulfill his promi≈øe of freedom, tis ≈øtrange to fle≈øh and blood) you can look for no other government upon their ≈øhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders then the whips of the Taskma≈øters, untill the time of deliverance from the Lord comes, who rai≈øeth up <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> to be their ≈øaviour and leader; but the judgements of his mouth during the whole cour≈øe of his government, were for the greate≈øt part extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, even from the mouth, or Spirit of the mo≈øt high God, which although it ≈øhews how nigh a relation holine≈øs and obedience can work betwixt man and God, yet ≈øo far it ≈øheweth not ought as exemplary to us in our pre≈øent Magi≈øtracy, either the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior or ≈øubordinate, in ordinary juri≈ødiction; neither the Acts or judgements of any of tho≈øe Judges afterwards, in ≈øuch ≈øpecial cau≈øes of evident ≈øupream, either direction, or a≈ø≈øi≈øtance: neither during their forty years peregrination in the wilderne≈øs, nor in their daies of re≈øt, untill they called for a King, nor indeed at any time: That is, we are not to take what ever one judges ≈øupream or ≈øubordinate, in ordinary juri≈ødiction or legall government ≈øay, as a binding word i≈ø≈øuing from an infallible ≈øpirit, or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ≈øuch divine directions; But according to the re≈øpective laws, and cu≈øtoms of the place and Nation wherein we live, ordered according to the rea≈øon, and nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity

But ≈øeeing all that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> did was not extraordinary, let us a little view his behaviour, in the cour≈øe of this narration, even of that man with whom ≈øo extraordinary a ≈øpirit re≈øted; for his fir≈øt actions I leave the reader wholly to Scripture (only this, he was under per≈øecution from his infancy, being then expo≈øed to the mercy of the waters only) for what I ≈øhall ≈øpecially aim at, ≈øhall be, and are his acts judicial, and tho≈øe either in referenre either to Church or Common-wealth; The fir≈øt law of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> mouth was not only binding to the <hi>Jew,</hi> but from the equity of it, was, and is, the pure principle of obedience to the ≈øupream powers, Obey God; for where that is not, or cea≈øes, the other is little ob≈øerved; ≈øo that ≈øome, which it was thought believed no God, yet profe≈ø≈øed many, by that ≈øuper≈øtition to inforce a reverence, and from thence obedience. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> now not only gives, but admini≈øters law al≈øo unto the people; in the next place looks to ≈øetling of civill judicatures, in the ≈øtabli≈øhment of Judges, and giving rules for the choice of Judges and admini≈øtration of ju≈øtice; wherein it is worth ob≈øervation, that the advice <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> receiveth herein, though not from the mouth of Almighty God, but of <hi>Jethro</hi> his Father in law, yet being agreeable to good rea≈øon, (I ≈øay no more) he yields, enquires not of God, nor did God alter it after, becau≈øe not coming immediatly from him≈øelf, nor made any declaration by him≈øelf or <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> that it came from him, either to get the glory to him≈øelf, or to enforce with greater authority the acceptation of the ≈øame: Nor yet di≈øallows of it after, but approves it, and it was an e≈øtabli≈øht Law for the great judicatory of that Nation for ever according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The next thing was the Act of Almighty God in giving the laws whereby the people ≈øhould be judged, which were ≈øummarily comprehended and written in two Tables of Stone, (it may be to ≈øignifie their long or everla≈øting duration) which were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Gods own hand (according to our natural expre≈ø≈øion) unto <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> and by him, unto the children of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> Gods people; which Laws were of two ≈øorts, the fir≈øt concerning God, written in one Table; the other concerning man, written in the other; now the≈øe being as we ≈øay general laws, and difficultly could all ≈øins and offences by the common people be reduced to their proper Commandment, ≈øo that they would have pleaded ignorance, in excu≈øe of their ≈øin; Therefore God gives par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Laws, and Rules, for all emergent ≈øins, and ≈øets forth particularly the whole frame and order of the wor≈øhip, and ≈øervice he expected from his people, yea every circum≈øtance requirable therein, upon which the whole Law of God, or which God gave to the <hi>Jew,</hi> was or is thus di≈øtingui≈øhed, into morall and ceremoniall, relating from man to God in his wor≈øhip and ≈øervice of him: And into morall and judicial, relating from man to man; which later mu≈øt be thus opened; The Laws of the two Tables were and ≈øtill are by many ≈øuppo≈øed to be ab≈øolutely morall or perpetual, and that as well to the Chri≈øtian now, as to the <hi>Jew</hi> then; but the judicial not ≈øo; but of this more in convenient place and time. Now the≈øe judicial laws, commonly called <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> judicials, did re≈øpect both body and goods, all which ≈øtand upon ≈øuch order, as is mo≈øt agreeable to natural equity, to the well being of a Common wealth, and that, both in peace and war; To a mans ≈øelf, and al≈øo towards his neighbour, ≈øupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, and inferior; yea in all things tending thereto; which laws as the <hi>Jew</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them from the hand of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> as their cheif and governor; ≈øo did they live accordingly, giving obedience to them all the daies of <hi>Mo≈øes;</hi> after whom, not <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øon or ≈øons ruled <hi>I≈ørael;</hi> neither by his, their, or the peoples ≈øeeking was any ≈øuch thing once mentioned, but the government (mo≈øt e≈øpecial gifts and graces, te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his divine vocation, ≈øhewing forth them≈øelves in him) was given unto <hi>Jo≈øhua;</hi> but no new law divulged, but the divi≈øion of inheritances to the ≈øeveral Tribes in their re≈øpective conque≈øts, was as the Lord had commanded <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> and he gave forth as a law to the people.

The next ≈øucce≈ø≈øor in government there given to them is <hi>Othniel,</hi> then <hi>Ehud, Shamgar, Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> then <hi>Gideon;</hi> the≈øe were by a ≈øpecial ≈øpirit of God rai≈øed up for the deliverance and ≈øaving <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> from the hand of tho≈øe enemies, into who≈øe hand for ≈øin their God had delivered them; But they ≈øtill departing from him, that is, from his Laws, not giving either any, or not due obedience, God as it ≈øeems intending to cha≈øti≈øe them yet more (as the ≈øtroaks or contentions of friends are mo≈øt bitter) ≈øuffers <hi>Abimelech</hi> the ≈øon of <hi>Gideon</hi> by unju≈øt and unu≈øed waies to ≈øeek not only the government, but a kingdom, yet after his death (who≈øe ambition was al≈øo puni≈øhed together with the peoples ≈øin (for the people were Gods avengers on him as he was of the people) now ari≈øes a new ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of Judges of ≈øeveral Tribes, and as it ≈øeems al≈øo by the ≈øpecial hand of their God upon them, as <hi>Tola, Jari, Jeptha, Samp≈øon,</hi> after who≈øe time there was as it were an <hi>interregnum,</hi> no King, no Judge in <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> and the manife≈øtation of the will of God by a ≈øpecial ≈øpirit to any chief of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> cea≈øed, and ≈øo for defect of worthy noble vertuous ≈øpirits, the government was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon <hi>Eli</hi> the Prei≈øt, in who≈øe time there was no manife≈øt vi≈øion; And though <hi>Samuel</hi> the la≈øt had it, yet it continued not after him, if it cea≈øed not to work at ≈øometimes in him, who as it ≈øeems rather out of fatherly indulgence (although he had ≈øeen the judgements of God upon <hi>Eli</hi> his Ma≈øter, and his family (for ≈øuch weakne≈ø≈øes are evident often in Gods deare≈øt children) then by divine appointment, makes his ≈øons Judges: but they turning a≈øide after lucre, and taking bribes, perverted judgement. Whereupon all the Elders of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> gathered them≈øelves together, and came to <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Ramah,</hi> and ≈øaid unto him; Behold thou art old, and thy ≈øons walk not in thy waies, (that is righteou≈øly) now therefore make us a King to judge us like all Nations.

Whence mark, in the purity or pure≈øt of times, Gods Church was governed as a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in the declining daies it grew to a kingdom. The next thing to be con≈øidered of, is, to ≈øee the King ≈øettled in his Throne, wherein I ≈øhall fir≈øt ≈øeek out, how they came to have a King, that is, whether of divine appointment, or of their own election; tis truth that it ≈øeems both concurred, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 5. compared with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 15. but then the que≈øtion is moved ju≈øtly, who was the fir≈øt and principal Agent, the Lord in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing, or the people in requiring a King, which being plain on the peoples part, it is objected that the Lord in his fir≈øt laws to his people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 14. &amp;c. gave them a Rule concerning the choice of their King, namely one of their brethren, &amp;c. and that <hi>Jacob</hi> prophe≈øied of the ≈øame, and that God laid down the duties of the King, &amp;c. To which it is an≈øwered, that neither the prophe≈øie of <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor Gods laying down the Kings choice, duty, and ≈øuch like, no nor <hi>Samuels</hi> annointing <hi>Saul,</hi> by Gods appointment, proves any divine in≈øtitution, no more then the prophe≈øies, &amp;c. of great ≈øins and defections from God. &amp;c. warrants them: No, no, the utmo≈øt it holds forth is rather a Divine conce≈ø≈øion, then an original in≈øtitution; for the Lord in that eighth of <hi>Samuel,</hi> tells <hi>Samuel,</hi> the people had rejected him for being their King; and laying before the people by <hi>Samuel</hi> the u≈øage of Kings, ruling at li≈øt, or according to their own will and power, as it were to deterre the people from it, the peoples ≈øtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornne≈øs <hi>ver.</hi> 7. 8. and 19. and 20. ≈øhews plainly that in wrath, as the ≈øpirit el≈øwhere expre≈ø≈øes it, he gave them a King, that is, yielded to their de≈øire of a King; and <hi>Saul,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed by <hi>Samuel,</hi> was cho≈øen by Lot, and being hidden, was ≈øought, and by Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection found out of the people, and ≈øaluted King, with a God ≈øave the King; whence if it be thought fit to be objected, he was cho≈øen by Lot, and ≈øo the di≈øpo≈øition of that being from the Lord, the Lord appointed the King, its agreed; but thence to infer that Kings are of divine in≈øtitution, it followeth not: This only is properly rai≈øed thence, that God appointed that per≈øon <hi>Saul</hi> to be King of his own people: after <hi>Saul David</hi> comes to the Throne, and though by Gods appointment, and ≈øpecial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øignation, the hou≈øe of <hi>Saul</hi> contends with him; <hi>Ab≈øolom</hi> he Rebels, and carries the multitudes of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> after him; and <hi>Solomon</hi> the wi≈øe≈øt of the ≈øons of men ≈øucceeding, though by <hi>Davids</hi> appointment, yea by divine approbation many waies manife≈øted; if not fore-prophe≈øied, he ≈øo ≈øins, that the Lord rejects him, dividing the Kingdom, and

Now the≈øe laws were given in terror, as <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øaith, to prove them, that his fear might be upon them, that they ≈øinned not, (yet all was too little to hold in ≈øo ≈øtiffe-necked a people) and after the≈øe general laws, as the heads of common Ju≈øtice in the root, and branch, he gives other laws for all occa≈øions, both in re≈øpect of Magi≈øtrate and People, Ma≈øter and Servant, Parent and Child, Husband and Wife, Enemy and Friend, or Confederate; and that both for War and Peace, and that with re≈øpective ≈øecurity both to day and night, and that for life, Maime, cha≈øtity, goods, good name; and that as a bea≈øt might offend, with re≈øpect to him, as the Oxgoring, yea to bea≈øt as a ≈øufferer, as wandring, yea and to the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øomne≈øs and means of healthfulne≈øs of men, not only in their wandrings, but in their ≈øettled habitations, remaining ≈øtill the ho≈øt or congregation of God, not to have any defilement open to veiw, for all which I refer you to Scripture, with the re≈øt of the heads ≈øpecified from the twentieth of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and ≈øo onward; and having thus ≈øettled an outward law of peace, and re≈øt, or War and Captivity, or other Judgements, bound and a≈ø≈øured by threats and promi≈øes, the Lord now proceeds to the e≈øtabli≈øhment of the manner of his wor≈øhip, which was and is generally holden wholly typical, and cea≈øed in our ble≈ø≈øed and eternal Saviour the Lord Chri≈øt Je≈øus; and this I wholly at pre≈øent omit to enlarge, and now come to the third thing con≈øiderable, which is the manner of execution of the≈øe laws, which was very ≈øevere, as you may ≈øee in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment of <hi>Corahs</hi> ≈øin, and ≈øo in <hi>Achans.</hi> The men, wives, children, and all were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed, not only by God as in <hi>Corah,</hi> but after by <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> in <hi>Achan;</hi> a terrible God, a terrible law, and terrible execution; yea the law was extream rigid, if we regard the prone≈øs of mans nature to offend; what, a poor man to gather a few ≈øticks for his nece≈ø≈øity upon the Lords day, and dye for it? what, the Princes and holy men that knew as much by them≈øelves as by <hi>Aaron,</hi> all devoured by an earthquake, for their zeal in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ≈øacrifice to God? the people were ≈øo ≈øen≈øible of it (but in pre≈øumption) that next day they blame, if not threat <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> for ≈ølaying the people of the Lord. Now the≈øe laws were the then rule of the people of God, and by the≈øe did the people of God under the whole regiment of the law, eithr ju≈øtifie or condemn them≈øelves: So <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> How ≈øhall I do this, and ≈øin again≈øt God?

Now to all the≈øe laws were Promi≈øes annexed in ca≈øe of obedience; Threats in ca≈øe of di≈øobedience, which were often reiterated by tho≈øe ≈øpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, whom the Lord rai≈øed up, in the ≈øeveral generations, under the Judges, Kings and Kingly Prie≈øts, untill the Lord ≈øent his own Son to declare his will unto his people, in the fulne≈øs of time; and though <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> were faithful, yet that was but as a ≈øervant, as ≈øaith the Author to the Hebrews; but the Lord Chri≈øt Je≈øus, who is the Apo≈øtle and high Prie≈øt of our profe≈ø≈øion, is ≈øent from the bo≈øome of the Father, to whom the whole will of the Father was known, and in the≈øe la≈øt times God ≈øpeaks to his people by him, even his own Son, whom he made heir of all things, who being the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the glory, and the engraved form of his Fathers per≈øon, and ≈øu≈øtaining all things by his word, hath by him≈øelf purged our ≈øins, and ≈øits at the right hand of his Father; wherefore we ought with all diligence to attend to that heavenly doctrine which this our Lord declares; for if ju≈øt puni≈øhment were retributed by the Lord to them who di≈øobeyed the word ≈øpoken by Angels: how ≈øhall they e≈øcape who neglect the Go≈øpel given by the Lord of Angels, the Son of the Father, to whom the Angels are but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtring Spirits? him, of whom all the Prophets fore-prophe≈øied, even the <hi>Shilo,</hi> the <hi>Me≈ø≈øiah,</hi> the Saviour, who ≈øhould ≈øave his people <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> and lead them through the wilderne≈øs like a flock of Sheep, under whom they ≈øhould lye down in the plea≈øant places of re≈øt, and none ≈øhould make them affraid; He that was now expected by the <hi>Jew;</hi> and ≈øo much the rather, as fearing bondage from the imperious and flouri≈øhing <hi>Romans,</hi> and hoping of ≈øalvation and deliverance, temporal Grandeur, power, and dominion, by his pui≈ø≈øance, who was to break all Nations as a Potters ve≈ø≈øel, and thre≈øh them with an Iron Mace; to whom all people mu≈øt bow down, the mighty Councellor, the Prince of peace, and his yoak mu≈øt be upon their neck, and his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon their ≈øhoulders, till time ≈øhould be no more.</p>
                  <p>Now lets a little con≈øider how the ≈øtate of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> or the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> ≈øtood at the time of Chri≈øts coming; That they expected the <hi>Me≈ø≈øiah</hi> is evident, they ≈øeeing tho≈øe things fulfilled which were fore-prophe≈øied, of which ≈øure they were diligent heeders, e≈øpecially being driven thereto by ≈øo many daily fears, as the power of the <hi>Roman,</hi> and the Tyrany of their ≈øtrange King put upon them; and the Scripture notes of divers to whom God had imparted a true under≈øtanding of the light of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈øy, who kept continually in the Temple, and ≈øerved God day and night with fa≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prayers, looking for, or expecting his coming; and no doubt they had di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples abroad, who being in≈øtructed by them, had their hearts prepared to believe him, though no outward form, beauty, or comline≈øs (as others thought) appeared in him; So that their expectation was general; but each one after the rate of light and knowledge, true or fal≈øe, which was impared to him, or he had received under his Rabby, who read the Law to him, who were of ≈øeveral opinions, (not altogether dead yet) as <hi>Phari≈øes, Sadduces, E≈ø≈øenes,</hi> and the≈øe again ≈øubdivided according to the merit or acceptation of the Rabbies or Doctors of the Law.</p>
                  <p>The Temple was in re≈øpect of the legal ≈øtrictne≈øs polluted, the whole law by the≈øe interpretations, in≈øtead of Gods rule, become mans Fancy, or at be≈øt his precept; for all was now grown into the va≈øt Ocean of ≈øubtilty of conceit, and that Rabby was mo≈øt venerable who could flye the highe≈øt pitch in ≈øublime conceits, ≈øo that the pure Law was made a puddled fountain, and the ≈øpiritual heavenly meaning was lo≈øt in carnal voluptuou≈øne≈øs and ≈øelf-endedne≈øs; there was great learning, never more,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105181:16"/> but never to le≈øs purpo≈øe, much praying and fa≈øting, A≈øhes and Sack-cloth, yea and be≈ømearing their faces, to ≈øuborn humility, but all to hypocri≈øie; and yet ≈øure if in <hi>E≈øays</hi> time they Ju≈øtified them≈øelves again≈øt God as impotent, that he could not ≈øee their fa≈øting nor humiliation, and ≈øoul affliction, nor hear their prayers, nor an≈øwer them by deliverance, as in the fifty eighth of <hi>I≈øaiah,</hi> then much more now, when grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mercies were expected, and longer time had revealed more light; but they did all for pretence; this, and almes, and all, to be ≈øeen of men; to devour widdows hou≈øes, and enrich them≈øelves; though the whole State were beggered, eager and ≈øtrongly contending for priviledges, but ≈øtill to better them≈øelves, though greater lo≈ø≈øes to the publike accrued;

And by this expecting the <hi>Me≈ø≈øiah,</hi> and by him deliverance, and this was the ≈øtate of the <hi>Jew</hi> at the birth of our ble≈ø≈øed Saviour, born of <hi>Mary,</hi> at <hi>Bethlem,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> of the ≈øtock of <hi>David,</hi> yet as not own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inheritance in the world, brought forth in an Inn, his Cradle a Cribb, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øorts the Ox and the A≈øs, the room being no better then the ≈øtable; yet where God ≈øtirred up the hearts, there was he wor≈øhipped by Kings, if not by wi≈øe or learned men, of great e≈øteem; ≈øought to be ≈ølain, flyes into a ≈øtrange land, and then is brought by his father to a mean village, where he ≈øubmitted him≈øelf to all the laws which his ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> had delivered, not only in the circumci≈øion of his fle≈øh, but in fulfilling the whole law, and that not only private and dome≈øtick in his obedience to his reputed father, and his mother <hi>Mary;</hi> So that he was called not only the ≈øon of the Carpenter, but the Carpenter (untill ≈øuch time as he was called out to his Fathers work, which was fir≈øt at twelve years of age, to the a≈øtoni≈øhment, as confu≈øion of the Doctors, which was Gods Act of preparation to tho≈øe Rabbies, had they not had eyes that they might not ≈øee, and ears that they might not hear, becau≈øe the Lord would condemn them) but al≈øo in the publique admini≈øtration of the Jewi≈øh law, appearing by his going up there to the Pa≈ø≈øover, and that not only to his God (as man) but to his Prince, yea though a heathen, a ≈øtranger, giving his tribute to <hi>Cae≈øar;</hi> he had al≈øo a fore-runner, <hi>John</hi> the Bapti≈øt, in whom I mu≈øt ob≈øerve, that he preached a new doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> Bapti≈øm, yet even the rulers went out to him, and though he in his preachings ≈øhewed the error of the then ≈øort of teachers, he was not meddled withall, nor oppo≈øed, much le≈øs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øoned;

<hi>John</hi> he begins in (a ≈øtrange place) the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and he cries, Prepare the waies of the Lord, make his paths ≈øtraight; the Lord Je≈øus he follows, and in the land of <hi>Zabulon</hi> in the City <hi>Capernaum</hi> (the obdurate people had need of redouble blows) he preaches, and ≈øayes, Amend your lives, for the kingdom of God is at hand; and then he choo≈øes or calls to help him in this great work of reforming ≈øinners (and that of the greate≈øt ≈øort) poor fi≈øhermen, ≈øurely as rude and ignorant as the re≈øt, in ordinary, and the≈øe he makes his partners in the work, and now in≈øtead of expounding <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> law, according to the order of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari≈øes</hi> in the Synagogues of the <hi>Jews</hi> (places of publike meetings for that end, but alwaies intended for the ≈øervice of the mo≈øt high and true God by the <hi>Jew</hi>) he preaches the Go≈øpel of the <hi>Me≈ø≈øiah,</hi> and withall healed their bodies, no doubt to intimate that what he preached of the blindne≈øs of their mindes, was not only true, but that he would and could heal the≈øe al≈øo, he being for that end come into the world;

But the Lord him≈øelf I ≈øay did in no kind abrogate the day, which God in≈øtituted in paradi≈øe, though he cleared the <hi>Jews</hi> mi≈øtake in their manner of ob≈øerving that day.

Let us ≈øee the way for this: Fir≈øt, Chri≈øt taught, then his Di≈øciples, then each Chri≈øtian in≈øtructed one the other; and upon this ari≈øeth Sects and Divi≈øions, even in the Apo≈øtles times, ≈øome were of <hi>Paul,</hi> ≈øome of <hi>Apollos,</hi> ≈øome of <hi>Cephas;</hi> ≈øo that now what was the Church, of or in a Province, was, or might be divided into ≈øeveral Congregations; and that either differing in a Circum≈øtance, yet holding all the head in one Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of wor≈øhip upon occa≈øion, and ≈øo onely a Sect, or differing in opinion in things not plain but doubtful, or el≈øe in matters which were counted of ≈øuch value, or ≈øo nighly concerning the principal points of faith, that they did, as it were, rent from the Head, and would not admit admixtion, which were the producers of Schi≈øm; and this was, or ought to be as was at fir≈øt ≈øuppo≈øed, onely in here≈øie, things or opinions incon≈øi≈øtent with the rules of Chri≈øtianity, which either did appear, or it was declared would appear in <hi>Pauls</hi> time: Now how doth <hi>Paul</hi> deal with the≈øe. Truly what power he had concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that he either u≈øed not, or pretended not unto, is not po≈øsible to judge of; but what he u≈øed was according to the nature of the Covenant explained, which was of faith, for the works of the Law, in literal obedience; man may enforce obedience, but Grace is the onely gift of God; and therefore he onely u≈øeth the ≈øword of the Spirit, which was the Word, powerful indeed in a right and skilful hand, and no other; he informs, and labors to enlighten them, that Chri≈øt was the head; and if a member were divided from the Head it was no longer a member; and tells them plainly, that Chri≈øt was the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and who ever laid other, however wi≈øe in the ≈øight of the world, whether of wor≈øhipping of Angels, mediation by Saints, ab≈øtaining from meats, forbidding to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105181:18"/> marry, ob≈øerving of daies, and all ≈øuch like, though they had a ≈øhew of wi≈ødome, in voluntary humility, and beating down the fle≈øh, yet they were will wor≈øhip, the gate for <hi>Sathan</hi> to enter by, and by carnal ≈øeeming wi≈ødom, to build with hay and ≈øtubble, and daube with untempered morter, yea to change the truth of God into a lye through the decieveablene≈øs of the fle≈øh; for the≈øe precepts of men, being admitted, fir≈øt as explaining the will of God, were then accompted helps, then nece≈ø≈øary, then matter of faith; and this prophe≈øie, who is ≈øo blind that hath not ≈øeen fullfilled? therefore he advi≈øes, to beware of vain humane wi≈ødome, or philo≈øophy, which was bewitching, and tells that this my≈øtery of iniquity began to work, and would work, and that there would ≈øpring Here≈øies, yea that it was nece≈ø≈øary, but from the Go≈øpel no one mu≈øt depart, no not though preached by an Angel from heaven; and lea≈øt the people of God ≈øhould be di≈øcomforted by the afflictions and per≈øecutions of the Apo≈øtles, and other di≈øciples and profe≈ø≈øors, it is often plainly declared, they mu≈øt look to tread the trace which their ble≈ø≈øed Saviour had done, who was the high Prie≈øt of our ≈øalvation, who was perfected through ≈øuffering; but withal declares, and it is plainly laid down, a mo≈øt triumphant time ≈øhould follow, whether here, may be doubtful to many, but hereafter is believed by all. So that that weight of glory ≈øhall far out-ballance the ≈øufferings which any one under went for the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ≈øake. And truly the per≈øecution even after the death of Chri≈øt was immediately great by the <hi>Jew,</hi> and though God left him≈øelf not without witne≈øs, even among the wi≈øe≈øt of them, as in <hi>Gamaliel, Nicodemus, Jo≈øeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea, Paul</hi> mo≈øt notable, and others: yet there was little ce≈ø≈øation, through the great divi≈øion and factions, which God ≈øuffered them after the death of Chri≈øt to fall into, (<hi>Hieru≈øalem</hi> being a type of ≈øpiritual <hi>Sodom</hi>) gave warning to the believers in Chri≈øt, to flye out of that <hi>Babylon,</hi> that ≈øo it might be prepared for that fir≈øt coming of Chri≈øt to Judgement, which he did by the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Eagles flying and hovering over that carca≈øs untill the appointed time, when by them it was devoured; and now begins the cur≈øe upon the remainder of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> of the ten Tribes, <hi>Judah</hi> and the re≈øidue, for their ≈øins, being not forewarned by the great judgement, which fell upon <hi>Samaria</hi> and her children, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by that mo≈øt fearfull imprecation, His blood be upon us and upon our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which City thus taken out of the way, the per≈øecution cea≈øed not, but is renewed more bitterly, under the heathen Emperors and their ≈øub≈øtitutes, in the ≈øeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Empire, and let us mark the Divels cunning, all evils were laid to the charge of the Chri≈øtians, not only ≈øedition, and tumults again≈øt the State, but the cau≈øers of tho≈øe direfull evils, of War, Famine, Plague, Inundations which over ≈øpread the face of the earth; but the≈øe could not be ≈øo well proved; Though undoubtedly, the interpreters of the heathens Oracles gave good ≈øatisfaction to them were willing to believe it, but they had more evident Te≈øtimonies, if publike fame had not been ever ≈øubject to lying, they were breakers of all the laws of nature and nations; and this had ≈øome foundation in ≈øence and rea≈øon; for they that taught that the love of the Gods was not obtained for, nor yielded to good life, right dealing, earne≈øt ≈øerving of them, nay though accompanied with never ≈øo much inward zeal, or outward fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor; The Philo≈øophers could ea≈øily ≈øumm the po≈øitions of the Chri≈øtians into this General Doctrine, and then let them alone, to conclude, that ≈øurely there could be no expectation that the≈øe men ≈øhould do any thing according to the law, but for lu≈øt, or plea≈øure, or profits ≈øake, and therefore counted them enemies to all civill, moral laws, and living, and what could they then lay to their charge, which would not ea≈øily be believed of them, not only Adultery, but ince≈øt; not anger, but murder; not ≈øwearing or lying, but perjuries; and all abominations; and though the≈øe things were not done by day, their outward lives were civill and ju≈øt, it was in the night, and though common Ju≈øtice appeared in them to their neighbours, it was Hypocritical, their vitiou≈øne≈øs was acted among≈øt them≈øelves, or ≈øuch ≈øeeds ≈øown, as would infect a future generation; And no doubt <hi>Paul</hi> having blamed them for going to law with one another, but e≈øpecially before heathen Judges, which opinion they could not but hold in ≈øome part, while their Saviour taught them ≈øo oft to forgive their brother, and to him who would take thy cloak, to give thy coat al≈øo; the≈øe circum≈øtances were aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, as people looking at no Government, no order, no di≈øcipline; <hi>Pauls</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, exhorting, convincing, per≈øwading, holding no communion, delivering to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> were to them fancies of the ≈øpeculative under≈øtanding, and all his weapons, not

and as his care was ≈øo wonderful for the ≈øoul; he neglected not to put in execution good Laws, and where need was, to make new; his care was for the weal of his people; he ≈øought his peoples good more then their Goods, and approved him≈øelf the common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Country by his ≈øea of bounty, which all pertook of freely; the Orphans not onely educated but maintained; to which he not onely employed the publike money, but out of his private Trea≈øury he afforded largely; he would relieve the nece≈øsitous begger, but cau≈øed to be ≈øought out the mode≈øt needy wretch; and comparing qualitie and nece≈øsity, he fitted and proportionated his bounty accordingly; ≈øo that to emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent vertue, he hath given entire po≈ø≈øe≈øsions; yea, him≈øelf ≈øought out the de≈øolate, and afflicted; and all his Laws now ta≈øted of the radiences which Conver≈øion had gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in his ≈øoul, and were not onely moral, as agreable to Nature, but al≈øo Chri≈øtian, as ≈øavouring of that enlightment which our Saviour in his Preaching had given to the Law: and ≈øurely here was a glorious Court, where the Prince him≈øelf gave ≈øuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; how did the Nobles, the great, rich and powerful follow, e≈øpecially when the wi≈øe Emperor had fained a little inclination to Apo≈øtacie, and di≈øgraced the fawning para≈øitical and hypocritical Courtier, and exalted and entru≈øted the faithful to Chri≈øt, though not obeying the Emperor; and it was indeed admirable, all was wonderful; the Fathers of the Church were the Emperors Councel, not out of their ambition, or his nece≈ø≈øity, but to ≈øhew, his actions feared no Monitors, and his Councels ≈øhould be que≈øtioned by the ≈øtricte≈øt Chri≈øtians; and what might now be feared, was then reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: Thus did the Church flouri≈øh; but ≈øee here the devil was not conquered, though his Agents were; he now mu≈øt go another way to work; a wily Serpent he is, &amp; can turn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf into many folds, and therefore he now attemps new ways of tortures &amp; afflictions; and when the forraign enemies of the Church are beaten down and conquered, now he makes them enemies one to another; hitherto the common calamities had hindered the growth of divi≈øions; the Sword was the Lords avenger, he now ≈øuffers another; nay, Pro≈øperity u≈øhers in Pride, Pride Ambition, and that Envy as well as Covetize; and out of all the≈øe ≈øprings up Ariani≈øm, the fir≈øt great and ≈øpreading error to u≈øher in that fatall Apo≈øtacy ≈øo long before prophe≈øied; and if we look into the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of it, or the foundation, it was Philo≈øophy, or ≈øearching into the ≈øecrets of the divine Decrees, and the rea≈øons of them, the <hi>Arcana</hi> of the Trinity, the extravagant curio≈øities of able, idle, and yet active wits, ≈øet on by the itch of vanity, and ≈øingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from the ignorance which they ≈øee in others; and the applau≈øe of novelty from ≈øuch as count all things wondrous that is above the ≈øphear of their own capacity; and this was the fir≈øt comet of the kingdom of darkne≈øs, which in its growth threw darts of plagues and poi≈øons in≈øen≈øibly into the hearts and veins of the profe≈ø≈øor of Chri≈øt in its glorious condition; which to remedy, there is by the Emperor a general Councel called; (note, that was the then unque≈øtioned remedy) wherein though condemned by the power of mans Vote, yet neverthele≈øs continued his ≈øtrength, and was not vanqui≈øhed; for the Emperors, and all at la≈øt ≈øubmitted unto this rage of the flood of error, untill God in his time, who orders the ri≈øe, and fall, as la≈øting of all things, turned the ≈øtream into another channel: after by the Synod of <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> that here≈øie was tollerated, by ab≈øolution of the Patron, which the Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> had condemned; and by this tract of time, ≈øin growing ≈øpeedily, the Papacy began now to lay another ≈øtep to the grand defection; for the pride of the Pa≈øtors was now grown ≈øo great, and the revenue ≈øo eminent, that the Fathers of the Church fight for the Papacy; and if the man-childe born, the Church, went into the Wilderne≈øs, that is, no ≈øooner did the Lord cea≈øe afflicting his Church, and gave riches, and glory, and honor, but the purity and integrity of Ordinances cea≈øed; and if you would finde Chri≈øt anywhere, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that were either in the Wilderne≈øs, tho≈øe holy ones that were through
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105181:20"/> acerbities pa≈øt, ≈øo taught the vanity of the world, that nothing could bring them to the trial of the world again; or tho≈øe, that though they were in the City, were yet as in the Wilderne≈øs, ≈øuch as over whom the glories of the world had no power: Then ≈øure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now the Church was not to be found, except the two witne≈ø≈øes of the Lord, I mean the two Te≈øtaments were his Records; for if the Pa≈øtors were thus changed, how might the people err? And ≈øurely from this time I count the Prophe≈øie of Antichri≈øt began to be manife≈øted, and the Apo≈øtacy and great defection to appear; for immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately under the reign of <hi>Theodo≈øius</hi> the younger, when <hi>Alarick</hi> the <hi>Goth</hi> ≈øubdues <hi>Italy,</hi> and takes <hi>Rome, So≈øimus</hi> then Bi≈øhop of <hi>Rome</hi> affects the title of Oecumenical, and claims as proper to the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> That nothing in Eccle≈øia≈øtick affairs ≈øhould be ordered without his con≈øent; the fir≈øt linke of the chain of perdition. A non after ri≈øes the <hi>Ne≈øtorian</hi> here≈øie, then the <hi>Eutichian:</hi> and thus the Lord puni≈øhes his Church now; before, the evil was the Sword; now Error, the greater plague of the two; then purity increa≈øed, now prophanene≈øs; yet I cannot ≈øay ≈øo much prophanene≈øs, for even the lives of the then Heriticks are a ≈øhame and condemnation to our pre≈øent Chri≈øtians; yea, even in the defection of the Saints, how many humane excellencies appeared! what au≈øterity, what voluntary poverty, ≈øingular cha≈øtity, admirable con≈øtancie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd charity! And thus grew the glory of Chri≈øtianity, ≈øo that the Barbarous Nations, who were the ≈øcourges of Chri≈øtians ≈øins, were the admirers, and in ≈øome kinde the imitators of their piety; and it plea≈øed God there was yet ≈øome wheat amid≈øt the field of the Church, excellent in all the qualities and ornaments needful in a di≈øciple of our Saviour; by who≈øe indu≈øtry and faithfulne≈øs great part of true Chri≈øtian purity was not onely continued, but al≈øo propagated, as well as errors and here≈øies in great part vanqui≈øhed; ≈øo that the ≈øplendor of the Church of Chri≈øt was great and powerful; and ≈øo much the more, as for that the Church-men had now made ≈øome Quaeries concerning the power of the Emperors over them, as being the ≈øervants of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. And al≈øo of their power over Emperors, the Emperor being but a believer, they officers; he ≈øet apart, yet but for civil ends and Government; they for ≈øacred and divine: they begin the que≈øtion with the power of Calling, confirming, pre≈øiding in, and adnulling Councels, and ended in dethroning Emperors; They who undertook the conte≈øt were wi≈øe and able; and though they oppo≈øed a powerful, yet it was a devout Emperor, and ≈øhaken with homebred and inte≈øtine afflictions, frequent in the decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing e≈øtate of the Empire; this was heightened by what was then called zeal for Gods Altar; after that branded for ≈øpiritual pride, and accounted the highe≈øt ≈øtep to Antichri≈øtian error, opening the way to what ever followed with ea≈øe, placing an e≈øpecial ≈øanctity in ordination, from the Deacon to the Patriarch, and ≈øo to the Pope gradually; and in him, not onely to primacy, but ≈øupremacy; ≈øo that what was before evidenced by faith, and holy conver≈øation, was now ≈øolely attributed to impo≈øition of hands; this was a holy unction, an indelible Character, marking who were Chri≈øts; God left not him≈øelf without witne≈ø≈øes again≈øt the≈øe growing errors, in the ≈øeveral Ages, wherein they were propounded to the world, which gave ≈øome ≈øtop; but one error u≈øhering in another, ≈øtrengthened them≈øelves; ≈øo that at the la≈øt they ≈øhut truth out of doors.

The Bi≈øhops of <hi>Rome</hi> now labour an addition of believers in all Countries, and not onely <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Almaine,</hi> but even the remote≈øt Ilands of <hi>Britain</hi> receive the truth; the Church was to be univer≈øal, there
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105181:21"/> was a word of truth for it; But as the Emperors and Princes of the world had by ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral experiences found out the be≈øt and quainte≈øt waies of ≈øtretching their ≈øubjects pur≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrings without cracking, to be the gains and in-comes of ≈øutes and controver≈øies, which being the vents either of malice in pro≈øecution or victory in the i≈ø≈øue, and the party overthrown, though mi≈øerably complaining, were alwaies remedile≈øs, generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pittied, for it was done by Law, the rule of Ju≈øtice; The Bi≈øhops of <hi>Rome</hi> now begin generally to challenge to them≈øelves, not only for the honor, but for the nece≈ø≈øity of order, ≈øpecial government by way of judicatories, at fir≈øt only of matters ari≈øing within the precincts of his government as Bi≈øhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but after it extended by way of ≈øupremacy (the great inju≈øtice of all Princes giving colour thereto) to pluck away cau≈øes from the remote≈øt parts of the world after the Bi≈øhops had ≈øettled their powers, and by them courts in any kingdom, realm or nation; And from particular controver≈øie between per≈øon and per≈øon, Bi≈øhop and Bi≈øhop, he at la≈øt became the umpire of the controver≈øies of Kings, and by vertue of the nece≈ø≈øity of a final appeal, he gave away kingdomes as he plea≈øed, as the annals not only of <hi>Germany,</hi> but of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> do ≈øpecially commemorate; and now the name of univer≈øal Bi≈øhop would not ≈øuffice, nor the≈øe large temporalities be≈øtowed upon them by Princes, but they ≈øei≈øe the Cities of <hi>Romandiola, Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Bononia,</hi> and much more in the vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Empire; nay the little Horn would not re≈øt ≈øo contented; but the Emperors oppo≈øe; the Popes now produce the grounds of their actings, partly from rea≈øon, partly from Scripture, yet both agreeing in the ≈øub≈øtance, the nece≈ø≈øity of an umpire in the Chri≈øtian Churches, that this ab≈øolution mu≈øt re≈øt in the Church, whereof Chri≈øt was the head, <hi>Peter</hi> his Vicar, and the Pope his, that all the kingdomes of the world were now the Lords and his Chri≈øts, that he gave them to whom he would, that this his Vicar was the mo≈øt fit per≈øon, yea the only fit, if not de≈øigned, for he was the common father of ≈øouls, had the care of the Churches good upon him, that not only all were alike to him, but he bound alike to all the obligation too, the Church only excepted. This wrought con≈øcientiou≈øly in many, but actively in mo≈øt, though ≈øu≈øpected of ≈øelf-≈øeeking in ≈øome, covetize and avarice being the common error of great enjoyers, e≈øpecially in high and ambitious ≈øpirits; whereby the Pope was not without his Champions again≈øt all oppo≈øers; and as mo≈øt pretenders do, they did ≈øome ju≈øtice extraordinary at fir≈øt; but when the notion of infallibility was accepted, who could oppo≈øe? now the Church was in its ruff, and now the whole world turned reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and all Nations, e≈øpecially in <hi>Europe,</hi> were become ≈øo great admirers of Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an profe≈ø≈øion, that they erected Mona≈øteries, Frieries, Nunneries, and men and women were engaged on all ≈øides, all worldly obligements neglected for the ≈øervice of their Saviour, husbands for≈øaking wives, and wives husbands; Children and Servants leave Parents and Ma≈øters; nothing ≈øo ≈øecret which confe≈ø≈øion could not unlock; there was ea≈øe and plenty; ≈øo that the Popes chair having ≈øo many feet, it was in no great fear of falling; but lea≈øt the people ≈øhould di≈øcern this, the foundation of all is laid upon the indubitable word, ≈øo called of God, of which they are the ≈øole Expo≈øitors, and this by way of anology or ≈øimilitude betwixt the old and new law; Therefore they hold forth, that as among the Prie≈øts one was cheif under the law, ≈øo al≈øo under the Go≈øpel; and as the Prie≈øts, ≈øo their lips mu≈øt pre≈øerve knowledge; as there was a bloody, ≈øo here was an unbloody ≈øacrifice; and as there was a Temple, ≈øo here another Church, inferior Churches, as the Synagogues; the times of ≈øacrifice are called Canonical hours, and all the officers and offices of the Jewi≈øh frame, are now brought into the Church, and though acknowledged ceremonial in them≈øelves, and ≈øo pa≈ø≈øed away, yet the my≈øtery of them opened, and the end relating to the ≈øervice of God and his Chri≈øt now, as before to God under his name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> was allowed as nece≈ø≈øary for his better ≈øervice; and as the glory of the ≈øecond Temple was to exceed the glory of the fir≈øt, ≈øo the maintenance of the mini≈øters of Chri≈øt, and the outward lu≈øtre of ≈øervice, was to exceed it; but that they might fulfill the mea≈øure of iniquity, they bring in the u≈øe of Images fir≈øt into the Church only, then for private devotion; this was contrary to the <hi>Jews</hi> order; but they an≈øwered fir≈øt the <hi>Jews</hi> made pictures of fal≈øe Gods, they of the true; the <hi>Jews</hi> in the ≈øhape of bea≈øts and other Creatures, the≈øe of man, and that after God appeared in the likene≈øs of man; the <hi>Jews</hi> of God whom they had not ≈øeen, they of the Lord Chri≈øt; the <hi>Jews</hi> wor≈øhiped the ≈øtock, the repre≈øentation; they had it only for a remembrance; but the≈øe admitted; now follow mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,

The Bi≈øhops and Clergy-mens lives being yet not generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to ≈øcandall, many yet retaining a great deal of exemplary piety and purity, yea even in the bo≈øome of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for although it be ea≈øie for particular and private per≈øons to ru≈øh ≈øuddenly and immediatly into great errour, yet for Commonwealths, or the publick Governors, or common Societies, 'tis not ≈øo; for what they look at, is Supremacy and uncontrolable Government; if ≈øo, the jealou≈øie which people ever have had of their liberties, will cau≈øe them rather to introduce things by degrees, then at once, and that ≈øo by little and little they may with ea≈øe obtain what by ≈øeeking at once they had utterly lo≈øt. Thus did temporall Princes (for ≈øo we mu≈øt di≈øtingui≈øh while Bi≈øhops are become Princes) by their Subjects, and thus did the Popes by them; but it is now fit to leave the general di≈øcour≈øe, and to reduce matters as intended, to a more narrow compa≈øs then the con≈øideration of the whole body of Chri≈øtians, and look at ≈øpecially this Nation of <hi>England,</hi> which now having received the Faith of the Lord Chri≈øt, whether under King <hi>Lucius</hi> primarily, or under any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, whether fir≈øt preached here by <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> of <hi>Aramathea,</hi> or any other, whether Apo≈øtle or Di≈øciple of the Lord, but after more generally allowed, ≈øpread, or promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the coming of <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> the Monk from <hi>Rome,</hi> I ≈øhall not controvert, but allowing every man his opinion by whom fir≈øt introduced, where fir≈øt preached, and ≈øuch like; I ≈øhall take that only up which none will deny, which is, that about the time of <hi>Lucius,</hi> it was by publick and Magi≈øterial Authority fir≈øt allowed, and hath more or le≈øs ever ≈øince been continued, embraced, and followed by ≈øome in this Nation at all times, but generally by the whole Nation, though

I cannot but ob≈øerve again, that the≈øe Ages were very ignorant, ≈øo that the Church-men for want of others, were without ≈øcruple, commonly, if not generally, admitted the Seats of Judicature, in the ordinary Law Courts of the Kingdome, and were the prime men of the Kings Councel, ≈øo that there was nought to hinder, but only the pride and power of ≈øome warlike Noblemen, who in emulation ≈øtill oppo≈øed the Bi≈øhops; and as the Age grew more knowing, began to ≈øtickle again≈øt them.

                  <p>Now the King plots his own ≈øetlement; fir≈øt, as being a <hi>Norman,</hi> that is, <hi>French;</hi> he wills all our pleadings to be in <hi>French;</hi> for he being as chief Father of the Commonwealth, to ≈øee to all, ought to under≈øtand it; Next, he ought e≈øpecially for offences criminal, or tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes of force voluntary, to have the puni≈øhment of the offender, as a di≈øturber of the peace of the Commonwealth, as well as the particular party to have reparations; and therefore he brings in, together with Appeals, the ancient u≈øage of <hi>England,</hi> which was the challenging of a man to have committed an offence, as of trea≈øon, murder, rape, felony, and the like; a kinde of ≈øuit in the name of the King, called an Indictment; and truly all the rea≈øon of the introduction that I can ≈øee, was to advance the end of the Kings gain; for here the King hath all the gain; all the goods of the party (at fir≈øt) from the day of the offence done; truth, now he hath it in appeal; but it was not ≈øo; for this, the old true tale of <hi>Kents</hi> freedom will be known Evidence; for they oppo≈øed this part of prerogative; and then the father to the bough, that is, to be hanged upon the arm of a tree, the u≈øual and ready way then of di≈øpatch, and the ≈øon to the plough, that is, to the improving the inheritance left: Concerning the common Law, Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of a Prince, or what the Laws of <hi>England</hi> anciently, as by the right and light of natural knowledge, granted to their Kings, a certainty of land of the Crown, Mines of gold and ≈øilver, Royal fi≈øhes, lands de≈øerted of the ≈øea, and of them who died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heir, as the prime per≈øon in whom the honor and glory of the people re≈øted, I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ≈øpeak at pre≈øent: Truly that this <hi>William</hi> u≈øed Parliaments, I finde not, though others do; for it is evident to the world, and he that is not blinde may ≈øee; he to quiet the people, pretended Title; but his intention was to make it his ab≈øolute conque≈øt; he therefore calls Councels, where his Lords were pre≈øent; they do what his Will is, and there is an end; So that grant it a Parliament, or National A≈ø≈øembly of the E≈øtates, yet it was but to grant or enact what the King de≈øired; his <hi>Normands</hi> had liberty to ≈øpeak their will, what Engli≈øh man dur≈øt oppo≈øe? but the acts of his ≈øucce≈ø≈øor fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrate this; who de≈øtroys thirty towns and Churches to make a Forre≈øt: the Monks of the time dur≈øt ≈øpeak, but who el≈øe?

                  <p>But it may be Quaeried, what all the ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of Princes all this while did for the Church? truly all they could both by them≈øelves and Subjects, multitudes of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Mona≈øteries, Fryeries, Nunneries, Abbies, Chappels, all planted in the mo≈øt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant delicious places of the Nation, admirable and co≈øtly ≈øtructures richly furni≈øhed, largely endowed, both with lands and yearly profits of Tythes, onely to ≈øend a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to preach; and now the common maintenance of the Church or Church-men cea≈øed, and was made proper, and after was drawn into that civil order, which we now call a Pari≈øh, being a limitation of the bounds of the Church, for care of ≈øouls and maintenance; and though indeed there was ≈øo great a ≈øufficiency, yet even then many of the Clergy were in want; it may be the Pope thought it fit ≈øome of Chri≈øts Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ≈øhould be like their Ma≈øter; I mean of that ≈øo called, and ju≈øtly at fir≈øt, the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> Order, according to their ≈øtile, commonly called the Begging Fryers; for ≈øo they did upon con≈øcience of the Rule of our Saviour, Go forth into all the world, take no care for any thing, one coat, no money, not a ≈øtaffe, no nor ≈øandalls; the≈øe went bare-foot, preached diligently, expecting onely what God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved peoples hearts to be≈øtow upon them; for they beleeved, that God that ≈øaid, The labourer is worthy of his hire, would not ≈øuffer them while they laboured to want.

                  <p>I mu≈øt now return to the civill State, where the Kings as I tell you, ≈øtill laboured to maintain their Prerogative, ≈øo called, by which they intended the ab≈øolute rule of their will, holding all that was yielded by the Law, not as <hi>datum,</hi> or given, but <hi>debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi> therefore they refu≈øed it not, but laboured to encroach, and therefore there was no immunity granted to the Subject, but they paid for it; no right cleared, but bought at the harde≈øt market; yet upon the≈øe chaffers the Kings ≈øettle the Courts of Judicature, both of the Common Pleas, Kings-Bench, Exchequer, and appoint Judges and ≈øalaries at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> a certain place, and at certain and appointed times, whereby the great and arduous cau≈øes, the difficulties of which could not be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ordinary Judges of the County, might by the≈øe eminent and mo≈øt learned, or ≈øo e≈øteemed, receive a period with le≈øs charge to the Subject, and to the≈øe were appointed Officers and Fees: After this the Chancery was ≈øetled, and the chief Judges of all the≈øe Courts, I have read, the Parliament were to appoint, and they might if Annuall; but if but every ≈øeven years, as by after agreement was e≈øtabli≈øhed, it was requi≈øite to admit the king the choyce once, and then to be ≈øure he was like to keep it for ever, (there was a pre≈øident) out of the≈øe Courts the kings rai≈øed large ≈øupports; for all the Officers which were now multiplyed, went all along with the Crown; and yet the≈øe Courts the kings liked not, but laboured to introduce other Courts, the ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of all the≈øe Judicatories by way of gradation, admitting a finall appeal to Parliament in cour≈øe; therefore the Court of Wards is erected, and that upon a good colour, but a bad cau≈øe; for the latter kings having ≈øeen the i≈ø≈øues of things before, as is related, now neglected the warlike education, and the preferment of their Wards, as at fir≈øt in≈øtitution; indeed the cau≈øe which was then, that was the putting by degrees the whole power of the Land by Marriages, was now cea≈øed; and now none bare le≈øs affection to the king, then the race of <hi>Normans,</hi> the i≈ø≈øue being like in condition with the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> ill brooking the ≈øervice and va≈ø≈øalage which them≈øelves laboured to lay upon the <hi>Engli≈øh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this Court came up the Court, ≈øo called, of Star-Chamber, intended ≈øtill as a bridle to curb the head-≈øtrong humours of the Lords and great men.</p>
                  <p>There were erected Courts of Admiralty, and all the≈øe Courts were bounded, had their Rules in all circum≈øtances; the defects of which were ≈øtill, as I ≈øaid, lyable to appeal, that is, to be que≈øtioned in Parliament; the Law Courts, and Statutes, Courts of cour≈øe, the other agreeable to their own nature by ≈øupremacy of power; neither were the Spiritual Courts ≈øo called, that is, the Courts of, or under, or by, or from the juri≈ødiction, power, authority of the ≈øo called Clergy, from the highe≈øt Bi≈øhop to the meane≈øt Surrogate of other ≈øettlement; yet in the≈øe the Kings were chary; for they appealing to the Pope, a cur≈øe might follow; and who that hath a due con≈øideration of con≈øcience, can blame the Princes, Judges, Magi≈øtrates and Officers of tho≈øe times, ≈øeeing they pretended to beleeve the Popes Supremacy of power, and all other things conducing thereto?</p>
                  <p>But now we ≈øhall ≈øee a ≈øtronger oppo≈øition to the Pope then ever; for he ≈øending out many prophane Indulgences, as for pardoning of the greate≈øt offences, and

                  <p>Now here I mu≈øt ob≈øerve, that <hi>Luther</hi> broached no new matters, it was the old Scriptures, and the old truths of the Scripture; but the men that then lived, thought it then ≈øtrange, and novelty, as being contrary to what they had been trained up in. Of all the forreign Princes to <hi>Germany,</hi> who ≈øtickled in this bu≈øine≈øs, none ≈øo hot as the king of our <hi>England,</hi> then called <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, a Prince not e≈øteemed ≈øo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious as Warlike, nor approved ≈øo Warlike as fierce, every violent ≈øpirit not being for the management of Military Atchievments; and to ≈øpeak the truth, the ea≈øe and delicacy of Court breeding, imbecillitates the mind, and enervates the body for the pains, care, and danger of War: This king neverthele≈øs, had ≈øure ≈øome de≈øign in his head, to gain his Holy Fathers good will in, as other Princes; he therefore writes, or cau≈øes to be written, which he fathered, a Book again≈øt <hi>Luther,</hi> in maintaining the Popes power, yea even in the unju≈øte≈øt matters; that is, That <hi>Luther,</hi> a Va≈ø≈øal of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> a Child of the Church, ought not to judge the Fathers acts, nor cen≈øure, much le≈øs controul matters allowed by him, much le≈øs authorized, nay commanded; for the bearer of the Indulgences had his Letters mi≈ø≈øory, or Bull, ≈øo called. <hi>Luther</hi> bears this ≈øhock, and all and alone ≈øtands the dint of the whole, ≈øo called, Chri≈øtian world, a few men, and one or two inferiour Princes, with an univer≈øity, excepted; but this notwith≈øtanding, <hi>Luther</hi> teaching and holding forth the Doctrine of Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles, fears not, and multitudes are converted (I may ≈øay to the Faith) from the Pope to him, he appealing to a general Councel; but the Princes oppo≈øe with the Emperour, as well as our <hi>Henry;</hi> and good rea≈øon, as I before declared, ≈øet the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel to order the Popes matters, and a Parliament or Dyet will by Analogical Rule argue, at lea≈øt (rationate at fir≈øt, and at la≈øt determine) of the rule of Princes; let a Fryer que≈øtion the Pope, and any Subject may as well altercate with his Prince, and at la≈øt appeal to a Parliament, as <hi>Luther</hi> to a Councel; truly all the irregular Intere≈øts of Popes, Cardinals, Bi≈øhops, Prie≈øts, and the re≈øt of that rabble, and of kings, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Judges, Advocates, as Lawyers and the re≈øt hang upon one thread; and I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume that one ≈øword at one blow cuts at la≈øt both a≈øunder; a≈ø≈øuredly as they have ≈øtood, ≈øo they will fall together; but mark Gods way; our <hi>Henry</hi> was a di≈ø≈øolute young Prince, and he married young, and to a widdow, nau≈øeous to ≈øuch a ≈øpirit, vain, though Heroick, or magnanimous, to give it the be≈øt among ≈øuch epithites; he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øirous of a divorce, which he at fir≈øt at lea≈øt ≈øought, not ≈øo much (as is mo≈øt probable) for con≈øcience, as humour ≈øake; for this change he ≈øeeks the Popes di≈øpen≈øation; ≈øhe was a daughter of <hi>Spain,</hi> the elder ≈øon of the Church, that is, the mo≈øt ambitious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ≈øo called, Chri≈øtian Princes, which now ≈øtood ready at all a≈ø≈øayes to act the Popes plea≈øure.</p>
                  <p>He was nigh and potent, and mu≈øt not be di≈øplea≈øed; the Pope dallies, puts the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh</hi> king, de≈øirous and hoping of a divorce, upon an injury to his Crown, as it is at la≈øt re≈øented, by making him in a private manner, as a ≈øubject to the Pope, appear before his Legat to an≈øwer his fact.</p>
                  <p>Truth is, the very Court of <hi>England</hi> was now tainted with <hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding the kings Book, and the≈øe men taking opportunitie of the kings wrath, blow it up to ingratiate them≈øelves and advance their intere≈øts, by ≈øubverting their enemies, they in≈øtill into the kings eare, a Rhetorick plea≈øing enough to a high and angry ≈øpirit; namely, that he had no dependance on the Pope, his Royalme was free: True, his predece≈ø≈øors either of weak Title at fir≈øt, or controvertible at la≈øt, of weak parts, or in a turbulent State, either dur≈øt not, or did not openly oppo≈øe, yet truly did what they could to extingui≈øh that power that they beleeved u≈øurped: The king upon this, re≈øolves to proceed without the Pope, and at la≈øt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving experienced many wayes, receives ≈øatisfaction, and withall, to de≈øpight the Pope, renounces his Supremacie, and gains it Enacted by Parliament.</p>
                  <p>But to ≈øhew his zeal to the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> Religion; he continues the Act, ≈øo called, of the ≈øix Article, a mo≈øt bloody and Popi≈øh device, and executes it, by which two conttary

                  <p>He therefore fei≈øeth the rich Abbies, Mona≈øteries, Nunneries and Frieries; and as before the Knights Templers once faln had many ≈øins laid to their charge, which it was believed they never did; ≈øo the≈øe had many ≈øins found, which it was proved they might well be charged withall, which but few ever believed of them, as Sodomy, Bea≈øtiality, Murder, and the like; for Adulteries and whoredoms they were known, and he ju≈øtified his actions by the actions of the late named Cardinal <hi>Wool≈øey,</hi> who had, as he ≈øaid, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed little Mona≈øteries to build a great Colledge; and he de≈øtroyed great ones to ≈øupport a noble Kingdom; intimating, that he found that the≈øe would be his enemies in his conte≈øt again≈øt the Pope, to whom they were more ≈øurely tied then to him; ≈øo that in ca≈øe contention came, this was ≈øo provided for, as a dangerous fire hid within his own bowels; the lands he exchanged with his Lords, Nobles, and Servants at ea≈øie rates, whereby he was little advantaged, and they highly obliged, whereby he got fa≈øt friends again≈øt the Papal power; and they that would not exchange, were noted as favorers of the Pope; and from this change fir≈øt aro≈øe our Lay-preachers, or Impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators ≈øo called: See how God works his ends again≈øt his enemies, not a title of, or for God intended, and yet his work done; and <hi>Henry</hi> hath the glory of the fir≈øt Reformer, yea, and his Declarations pronounced no le≈øs then zeal for Gods Glory; but what he truly had, others as truly de≈øerved in his Court, who≈øe faithfulne≈øs to their Prince, and zeal for Gods Hou≈øe, yet at la≈øt by the malignity, even of the contrary faction, was, when his ≈øervice was ended, and the Kings coffers full, rewarded with an Axe, ≈øuch fickle things are Princes, the ≈øons of men; and this is the promi≈øe of the faithful in this world of affliction, in the life to come eternal felicity: this was the fir≈øt turn of the wheel of wrath again≈øt the≈øe Apo≈øtates from the purity of the Go≈øpel, and the practi≈øe of the Go≈øpel; having left the Service of Chri≈øt to ≈øerve them≈øelves in the honors, riches, glories, pomps and vanities of the world, lu≈øts of the fle≈øh, and pride of life; and now as wave ≈øucceeds wave, ≈øo doth ≈øorrow, ≈øorrows to the≈øe children of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs; for the ≈øon makes clean work, and hardly leaves a handful of Popelins in <hi>England;</hi> and this was pre≈øumed to favor more of con≈øcience, becau≈øe they ≈øaw not the hire of the work, there was little pay for their pains; but he of ≈øhort continuance.</p>

                  <p>I ≈øhall not progre≈øs further here concerning ought, being now come to the portall of the Theater of all Quaeries in the multitude of que≈øtions ≈øtirred up in the Raign of King <hi>Charles,</hi> who ≈øucceeding his father with all the expectations that might be of the vulgar, his entertainment to the Crown was with all congratulations of a high joy, ≈øuch as the high condition of his e≈øtate required, in a ≈øetled Kingdome, having enjoyed a continued peace for almo≈øt 140. years, whereby riches abounded exceedingly; but with them pride increa≈øed, ≈øo that ≈øpirits grown high, they were ready to kick at the prick; and the rather, in re≈øpect knowledge abounded, and they were not ignorant of their own ≈øtrength: And what the Romani≈øts fore≈øaw, was now held high time to provide for; for whether it were the advice of King <hi>James,</hi> or the di≈øpo≈øition of <hi>Charls,</hi> or the natural jealou≈øie of Kings, or the ≈øupream over-ruling decree, intending by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to fit things to the determinate end, I here di≈øcu≈øs not; but this bright day was ≈øoon ore-ca≈øt; for in the fir≈øt Parliament, which I ≈øuppo≈øe, was called in or about the third year of this King, after ≈øome order taken for the regulation of evils again≈øt the civil peace, and ≈øome kind of care taken for puni≈øhing the great prophaners of the Lords Day; the King not well liking the Petition ≈øo called of Right, being indeed a ≈øtrong limit to dreaded Prerogative, yet grants it, and continues the Parliament, untill he had obtained ≈øeven Sub≈øidies of the people di≈øtinct, and eight from the ≈øo called Clergy, and then di≈ø≈øolves it: But there was another ≈øpecial rea≈øon, namely, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were grown exceeding high and fierce again≈øt not only the ≈øpecial Favourite of the King, the then Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> but ≈øecretly taxing the King him≈øelf, as at lea≈øt an Abettor to him, in the too ≈øoon ≈øpeeding his Father out of this world.

                  <p>They had large Palaces of old Babel, the ≈øame ≈øeats in their ≈øeveral Provinces called Dioce≈øs, the ≈øame ≈øtructures or great Churches, the ≈øame Attendants, (for their Courts Juridical were not taken away) the≈øe all required maintenance, and that by rea≈øon of worldly pomp in great mea≈øure; but they had enough for this, had not the itch of the fle≈øh brought them as other men to avoid fornication, to betake them to their own wives; and the ≈øame carnal prudence which before prohibited Marriage, le≈øt the care of the world, and love of children, &amp;c. ≈øhould cau≈øe imbe≈øelling the Churches, ≈øo called, Revenue; the ≈øame now wrought unju≈øt ≈øeekings of gain by any means, to the prejudice of the Church.

                  <p>And this Apo≈øtate order was univer≈øal: Again, the Bi≈øhops now made injunctions, ≈øome one, ≈øome another at their own wil; and the breach of all, or any of the≈øe, was cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizable in any their Courts, from the Chancellors to the High Commi≈øsion (≈øo called, indeed a pretty <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Inqui≈øition) yea ≈øo far as to puni≈øh the not-wearing of a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice at the reading the Liturgie, or ≈øo called Common Prayers, or ≈øet and publike appointed prayers in the Church, with impri≈øonment during plea≈øure, fine of 1000. l. when a Bla≈øphemer, for ≈øpeaking the≈øe dreadful words to the eares of any but an Athei≈øt (he being admoni≈øhed for ≈øwearing, ≈øaid) I will ≈øwear God out of Heaven, and ≈øit there as God my ≈øelf, was fined but 100. l. and mitigation of impri≈øonment.

And now the Queen being Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, that is, Romane, the Liberty of the Ma≈øs grew from the Queens private hou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, to a mo≈øt frequent hou≈øhold duty, and at lea≈øt was publique, yet not with any toleration, that is, if toleration be taken for a legall Act authorizing; but if for an impunity, notwith≈øtanding many and oft complaints, there was a grand toleration; and the Judges had by ≈øpecial order from his Maje≈øty, command again≈øt them, under the name of Recu≈øants; but with this hint, that there was a more dangerous Recu≈øant, called the Puritan or Browni≈øt; for then there was no di≈øtinction; ≈øo that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops armed with the power of the Civil Magi≈øtrate, under the late ≈øchi≈ømaticall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ≈øo termed at <hi>Rome,</hi> of his having both the Keyes, that is, being the ≈øupream ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vulgar acceptaion, both in Civil and Eccle≈øia≈øtick Juri≈ødiction, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ≈øtrict notion, having the ≈øupream intendency, not only over, but in the Church, which the Puritan urged with ≈øo much warine≈øs, ab≈øolutely holding the Lord Chri≈øt the ≈øupream, and yet craving the Maje≈øterial power, to ayde and a≈øsi≈øt with the name of ≈øupremacy, ≈øo far as ran even with his opinion; that it was doubted he was as ill a willer to the ab≈øolute Juri≈ødiction of the Prince in the Church, as the Papi≈øt was; ≈øo that he was exploded the Court, and no allowance given to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine there; and indeed with all po≈øsible vexations of the Lawes, by impri≈øoning, fining, attending, delaying, ≈øtigmatizing, &amp;c. all that were ≈øo called were handled by the Bi≈øhops, and the ≈øo called Clergy, with their Officers; no marvel; for the≈øe men, generally Lay men, preached in their writings more and more edifying Doctrine, then the Clergy in their Pulpits; and the≈øe mens lives and labours were as exemplary for godline≈øs, as the other for vanity, pride, lazine≈øs, and debauchedne≈øs; yet the≈øe (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they were conformable, that is, obedient to the Fathers of the Church, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops, be it right or wrong) were freely almo≈øt only allowed; for money now could do all things, and nece≈øsity more; there was on the one ≈øide Symony upon Symony, yea much legall Symony, for the great rich Livings; and whether the Prie≈øt could preach or not, his Curate could, and where the Impropriator had a large revenue, the poor Curate not above 10. l. <hi>per annum,</hi> and 20. l. a large ≈øtipend, he mu≈øt be of weak parts, that would ≈øo re≈øt contented, and ≈øeek no other preferment; this brought in together with ≈øo many Pari≈øhes as bad as impropriate, being in the gift of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Churches, where Bi≈øhops or Dean and Chapters had the gifts, ≈øo many ignorant, lazy, debauched fellows into the Mini≈øtry, that a Chri≈øtian would ≈øtand amazed: And when ≈øome pious men ≈øought a way to purcha≈øe out the≈øe impropriations, and to ≈øettle an able religious preaching Mini≈øtry, they were allowed to expend their monies, which I beleeve they never ≈øaw penny of again, but were ≈øo frowned upon and di≈øcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, that the beginners being wearied, the work even dyed in the fir≈øt Cradle; for the≈øe things made the Bi≈øhops plot for life, and as plain as words could manife≈øt the intentions of men, it was re≈øolved, No Reformer, as they now begin to call them, ≈øhould ≈øtay in <hi>England;</hi> and indeed their troubles grew ≈øo fa≈øt upon them, that they

                  <p>I ≈øhall now as ≈øhortly give you a veiw of the civill State, as the nece≈ø≈øity of per≈øpicuity will well permit. You have heard upon what a politique Ba≈øis <hi>William</hi> ≈øo called the Conqueror, founded his Empire, which yet from evident cau≈øes declining even in the ≈øpace of his own and Sons Raign, did evidently ≈øhew the frailty of all humane wi≈ødome, and therefore might well in the ≈øpace of ≈øix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years be brought to nothing; and truly once for all to ≈øay it, I am in my con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence per≈øwaded that King <hi>Charles</hi> did ≈øee the want of Law in this land to govern the Nation rightly, and upon that foundation ≈øought to mould the kingdom to the ≈øimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of other Nations; for it is a ≈øure and certain principle that States grow old and Laws &amp;c. And if not reduced by reformation, there is a nece≈ø≈øity of a new formation. Now the chief thing which a Prince looketh at, is the power of War or the Sword; and this ≈øo far as the power re≈øted in the King, which was his Tenure, was clean lo≈øt, and gone; for the many tran≈ømutations of po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, had made many litigious que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, partly through the corruption of officers, not duly awarding proce≈øs again≈øt alienators without licen≈øe, partly other defects of certain boundaries, and partly the evill of time, which had through divers di≈øcents parcelled great e≈øtates into many per≈øons; So that there were many Tenants, but few Knights; and what was at fir≈øt an honor, to hold of the King or by Knights ≈øervice, becau≈øe the Tenants Son and Heire ≈øhould yet come to the education of a Lord paramount or higher then the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105181:31"/> Father, and ≈øo ≈øhould be bettered both for Arts and Arms; the Kings of late years had made them ab≈øolutely but the fees of their Servants, and the Heirs of gallant men were as bad as ≈ølaves to the will of the Kings Grantee: whereby they were yoaked unequally in marriage, or their e≈øtates were generally ≈øquei≈øed of ≈øometime a third, ≈øometimes a fourth, or fifth part in the Court of Wards; ≈øo that they that ≈øhould have been the Princes guard as it were, being thus prejudiced in their minority, and drinking in ha≈øtily the complaints of their friends, bewailing their Ward≈øhips as an in≈øufferable va≈ø≈øalage, could not heartily ≈øeek to maintain that power who≈øe ≈øub≈øi≈øtence was their ruine to eternity in all their progeny; and through the long tract of time it was grown to this, that almo≈øt any great or rich mens Son mu≈øt be a Ward; all Titles of Lands being ≈øo exceedingly intricated, that it was almo≈øt impo≈ø≈øible to clear it; and this rigor was never higher then in the daies of this King; ≈øo that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, for a ≈øetled <hi>Militia</hi> for his own defence he had none, but had left him≈øelf naked to the ≈øtrokes of any timely oppo≈øition.</p>
                  <p>Next, as he had robbed him≈øelf thus of power, ≈øo had the example of all the Kings in part, and the power from jealou≈øie in other part, deve≈øted the Lords of all power military, by dependencies of Knights ≈øervice.</p>
                  <p>The Oathes of homage and fealty the Kings had re≈øpited them to enhan≈øe a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and the Lords were not willing to urge that which had been ≈øo fatall to many their predece≈ø≈øors, through their dependencies; and being now grown generally loo≈øe, lazy or wor≈øe, from the long peace we had enjoyed, they had no conte≈øts but at Tennis, Drinking, Dicing, or wor≈øe ≈øports, and ≈øometimes a Law ≈øuite; The≈øe yet ≈øunk many of their e≈øtates, and they had no waies of rai≈øing them but by the Kings ≈øole favour; for there were no Lords now that had ab≈øolute power in any County; this made them wholly quiet; and the rather becau≈øe to be of an active warlike ≈øpirit, gave cau≈øe of jealou≈øie to a Prince; e≈øpecially of any who were not meerly his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (namely, of ancient popular Nobility, that is their Ance≈øtors of great repute with the people,) Many therefore retired them≈øelves, lived privately and quietly, in re≈øpect of the Court, but few of them with great love in the Countries where they were re≈øiant, carrying too ≈øevere a hand towards their Tenants, by racking of Farme-rents, and otherwaies, as Lords of Mannors enhan≈øing fines, as all the Gentry al≈øo at their own wills enclo≈øing of Commons for private profit; and by the evill example both of them≈øelves, Servants and Retainers, bringing a general Lewdne≈øs, Loo≈øene≈øs, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d debauchery in religion and civill manners into all the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Nation.</p>

                  <p>But a≈ø≈øuredly the foundation of this mi≈øchief was principally in the abu≈øed practi≈øe of the Courts of Ju≈øtice of this kingdom; which holding al≈øo a <hi>Jewi≈øh</hi> dependency as before was hinted, there was no ≈øtint of ≈øtrife; for the Law admitted appeals, and what was ≈øo called the Subjects due, ought not be denied them; ≈øo that if you had either a knavi≈øh or a powerfull adver≈øary to deal withal (which power is manifold, as either a great rich man, or greatly friended by the officers, or els powerful in a joynt ≈øtock, as a corporation, who≈øe united pur≈øes have ruled over all ju≈øtice and righteou≈øne≈øs what≈øoever in many places) you could not get right but with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that is loo≈øing by the bargain; the particulars I ≈øhall demon≈øtrate after; this ruined many, di≈øcouraged more, di≈øcontented all, (except the gainers, which were and are ≈øuch a rabble and bed-roul of names in both Laws, as would amaze a wi≈øe man, much more a Chri≈øtian;) for whereas a Chri≈øtian ≈øaith, let all things among

                  <p>The Laws of <hi>England</hi> held forth all things in practice; I ≈øay in practice (for the general rules or foundations of <hi>Englands</hi> Laws are good, whol≈øome and ≈øanative) ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolutely contrary; for it held forth in the letter you ≈øhould have right for every wrong; this general rule was good, but di≈øcend to the particular;</p>
                  <p>The Quaere now is what remedy for the wrong; an Action you mu≈øt pro≈øecute; But fir≈øt it is con≈øiderable by whom this Action ≈øhall be brought; for long ≈øuites and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øive have bin had: and then the party ought either to have one or more joyned with them; or where the Action was ioynt, it ought to have bin ≈øole, ≈øometimes in the re≈øpect of the nature of the Action, ≈øometimes in re≈øpect of the way of a≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing or recovery of damages; next it is con≈øiderable in what Court; for ofttimes 100. <hi>li.</hi> hath been ≈øpent in the Court, and then the Court had no cognizance of the bu≈øine≈øs, yet the able≈øt Lawyers in <hi>England</hi> advi≈øed within the ca≈øe or ≈øo accounted as mo≈øt favored &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But grant you hit the Court; then the Quaere is what Action; for one hundred Actions have been pro≈øecuted in the right Court, and before right and due Judges, and by the right per≈øon, and then the Action mi≈øtaken, it was deceit, and ≈øhould have been a Tre≈øpa≈øs; or a Te≈øpa≈øs where it ≈øhould have bin deceit; ≈øo almo≈øt in all matters of higher or lower nature; next agreeing what Action, where ≈øhall you begin your ≈øuite? out of what Court have your proce≈øs? and for your proce≈øs, whither from above, that is the Kings bench which now holds cognizance of all pleas, or the Common pleas the proper Court of all Subjects differences betwixt them≈øelves; at lea≈øt in the Common Pleas by original, in the Common bench by Latitat, or els in the Chequer by a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe that you are a Debtor to the King, or below in the County or City, if the ≈øum be not above their Trial; and for the Chancery and ≈øuch other Courts a Subpaena; and then the ≈øeveral Writs mu≈øt be i≈ø≈øued in due cour≈øe, or all is nought. Next for the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Writ, there is for the Chancery &amp;c. either the party plaintife or ≈øome other ≈øhows the writ to the Defendant, or leaves a part, or the body of it ≈øo called as the ca≈øe requires, at his hou≈øe, and if he appears not, proce≈øs i≈ø≈øues again≈øt his per≈øon; but upon the other, he mu≈øt be arre≈øted by a Serjeant (of the Mace ≈øo called, the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of a City) or a bayliffe, whether common, ≈øpecial, or of a liberty, there is not much difference, they are much alike. Now the≈øe mens livelyhood is under the Sheriffe to execute writs of all ≈øorts; to judgements and Executions they have a fee proper from the party; but that was ≈øet ≈øo long ≈øince, that it is not a ≈øufficient maintenance now; and rather then take paines to rai≈øe that, well fore≈øeeing the trouble it would bring, to alter all Fees in the Nation, they let them gripe the poor, and abuse the rich, and wrong all; Yea a≈ø≈øuredly they many of them take hire of the Debitor or Tre≈øpa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øer not to ≈øee him, and of the Plaintiffe or Creditor to ≈øee him; as the ≈øearchers or under-writers for cu≈øtomes formerly, or now for exci≈øe may do, either for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited or cu≈øtome ≈øtoln goods; So that ofttime the charge of arre≈øting, is as much as the Debt, and it is generally known that the≈øe men are the wor≈øt ≈øort of men; the old Law was, none to be arre≈øted but to find ≈øureties that his cau≈øe was ju≈øt, and that he would pro≈øecute with effect; but that ju≈øt Law being too hard to many poor men, to ≈øurmi≈øe the be≈øt, was not remedied, but by practi≈øe (that is the unwarantable proceedings of Judges) Totally aboli≈øhed; and now a bill of Middle≈øex may abu≈øe any man unknown, and the law is made a ≈øtale to the both foolery and knavery of Sycophants or wor≈øe; there is much pleaded for this arre≈øting by Bayliffs; as fir≈øt he is a known and ≈øworn officer; I ≈øay only if he be ≈øo, let his Summons without a Writ or attaching the per≈øon be enough; and if twice ≈øummoned, let him be proceeded again≈øt as to his goods, who will not appear, provided he be at or in Town; but this is beyond my taske intended here.</p>
                  <p>There is another way of making the offender appear, which is by Utlagary, u≈øed very unju≈øtly, and ≈øo confe≈ø≈øed but as good as the re≈øt. The next thing is where I mu≈øt lay my action; that is, in what County. And many times the action is laid in <hi>London</hi> for a matter

I now return to what I had omitted; which is, that by Law, that is the cu≈øtome allowed, A Sheriff, or under-Sheriff ≈øhall make Returns of Cour≈øe onely for the benefit of Officers; as for example, that the party was not found within his Baylewick; or that he hath no goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when both are contrary; yet he is ≈øworn to excute all Writs truly; but this is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury by, or within the judgements of any the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Judges, becau≈øe not being within the niceties of their wi≈øe ≈øayings or re≈øolutions, no more then thou≈øands of other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, which though they may excu≈øe them≈øelves for, becau≈øe the Laws of the Land, ≈øo called, look not at them, as the Judges of ≈øuch perjuries; yet that they get no other Law e≈øtabli≈øhed, ≈øeeing the great want for redre≈øs of ≈øuch matters they finde before them, will be their or the Lands afflictions at la≈øt, but to go on in a cour≈øe of Triall. The≈øe difficulties over, I mu≈øt now put in my Declaration, that is, the narration of my complaint into the Court in writing, and that not in <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> but <hi>Latine,</hi> (though I under≈øtand never a word) and that in the form the Law requires, (though I can tell no more then the meer matter of my wrong) And in the ≈øame manner mu≈øt my adver≈øary, ≈øo called al≈øo, though little wi≈øer then my ≈øelf: But to help out this, we have Attorneyes, ≈øo called, allowed Deputies to an≈øwer for us, skilled in the way of practi≈øe (and the≈øe men they do even do what they li≈øt) for the Client, ≈øo called, is ≈øeldom knowing of practi≈øe; and he hath ≈øo much fir≈øt for his Fee; then drawing the Declaration or Plea, which is, either general or ≈øpecial, and though done with much difficulty and charge, is oft mi≈øtaken the one for the other; again double pleas are exploded; and though great advice taken which matter to plead, the be≈øt is left, and ≈øo left remedile≈øs at Law, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs a new bout in another Court help him, or el≈øe the Chancery; either of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies is generally wor≈øe then the di≈øea≈øe.</p>
                  <p>Now the rea≈øon of Attorneys was this; as riches multiplied, pride and outward pomp encrea≈øed, long ≈øuits came into fa≈øhion, and to maintain Officers, it was laboured for to avoid further ≈øuit, by the≈øe means to bring all Trials to the upper Bench, or common Pleas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And pleadings ordered wholly in form, and in Latine, which, what for ea≈øe, and what for (the ≈øo pretended being ≈øo made) nece≈ø≈øity, namely keeping of Records as pre≈øidents they were admitted, and to get an Attorney was difficult in ≈øuch chargeable pro≈øecutions, which to remedy, they were allowed privil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105181:32"/> half Fees with the Councel. I profe≈øs, and averr, that a late Judge did, being a Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, declare it to me, as an audacious part of <hi>I.

                  <p>But a≈ø≈øuredly they were grown very knowing in the practical part of the Law; and ≈øome of them have (among multitudes of more) had the≈øe abu≈øive practi≈øes laid to their charge again≈øt the Laws, as taking of <hi>Capias's</hi> from the Common-Pleas, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver filing an Original; This redounding meerly to his profit, abu≈øing the Officers of the Court to inrich him≈øelf, and not advantage his Client; for the Cur≈øitor, ≈øo called, loo≈øeth one ≈øhilling, the Philizer one ≈øhilling two pence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the Writ which is ≈øix ≈øhillings two pence, cometh onely to him, except for the Seal ≈øeven pence; and if this be di≈øcovered before Iudgement, though after Verdict, I believe it would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the whole proceeding.</p>
                  <p>So in ≈øuing forth the <hi>Capias utlag.</hi> For whereas upon true practi≈øe, a <hi>Capias</hi> being awarded to the Sheriff, who (by wicked cu≈øtome not looking after him) returns a <hi>Non e≈øt inventus,</hi> that is, upon a Writ to take his body, the Sheriff, though he might take him, returns him not found; whereupon another <hi>Capias</hi> or Writ to take his body, wherein of Cu≈øtome, as afore≈øaid, the Sheriff again makes ≈øuch a (perjured in Chri≈øtian accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) return again; then goes forth another Writ, mentioning what ado they have made to get him; and oft times he is out of the County indeed, it being done of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe in another County, that he might not know it; and then for his contumacy, he is exactioned, proclaimed, and out-lawed, and this oft in two Terms, which ought to be done in five by the Law; but little ju≈øtice in any part of it, though ≈øpetious in pretence; yet if the <hi>Capias</hi> were delivered to the Sheriff, there were ≈øome rule ob≈øerved; but the knowing Atturneys can do it them≈øelves, u≈øing the Sheriffs name, who never ≈øees the Writ, and did he, not one of a hundred can tell what to do, but by his under-Sheriff, a late con≈øtituted Officer upon the high made difficulties of Law, who being one of the ≈øame Tribe, calleth di≈øcovering of error defiling the nea≈øt, and ≈øo lets all pa≈øs as Cu≈øtome leads: Thus is a man put out by the Law of the priviledge of a Subject, and this only to maintain Officers; for let all the cour≈øe be examined, and the i≈ø≈øue will be nought el≈øe. I have known this ≈øued again≈øt a man, for that the Law gave no action, the party yet never demanded the thing; and of a man not worth twenty ≈øhillings in the whole world, and the matter it ≈øelf not worth five ≈øhillings, the Charges came to nigh four pound; and if he hath notice, no way but to ≈øue a <hi>Super≈øedeas,</hi> which is, I take it, forty ≈øhillings to the Judge; otherwi≈øe to the Gaole without mercy; of which Gaoles a word after. Next, this is an ordinary cour≈øe, at lea≈øt ≈øo reported, in petty tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes they declare of cour≈øe, meerly to get Fees upon agreement, though they a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign no place; others having liberty to proceed as they ≈øee good, and make an end, or do any thing, which is generally the cour≈øe of quiet poor people; there is favor promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to either party; he draws a judgement from his adver≈øary the defendant, yet ≈øues on ≈øtill, and brings it down to Trial <hi>Per Ni≈øi prius;</hi> then ≈øtops proceedings, with ≈øaying he will confe≈øs a Judgement, and enters it the Term after; others enter up Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Warrant; (I have known wor≈øe abu≈øes yet, but no puni≈øhments) oft for want of entring a Rule they ≈øuffer Judgement <hi>Per nihil dicit,</hi> whereby great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Charge accrues to the Client, and but ≈ømall gain to them≈øelves; but hereby they plea≈øure the Officers; oft times they plead or confe≈øs a <hi>Non ≈øum informatus,</hi> and this without Warrant, and then comes out a Judgement unexpected; and this dealing is ju≈øtly ≈øu≈øpected of fal≈øe dealing.</p>
                  <p>It was ordinary to enter fal≈øe Orders, fal≈øe Affidavits, imbezle depo≈øitions, pack Juries, draw Witne≈ø≈øes, if not make them; I know the labour and pains of a faithful and hone≈øt Attorney is great, and very painful and laborious, in running from Office to Office, from Clerk to Clerk, Officer to Officer, Councel to Councel, Judge to Judge, Court to Court; neither do I here que≈øtion their proceedings, who make ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law or con≈øtant practice their rule; But the≈øe rude, ignorant, young heads, who think and make it their way to gain practice, to over-reach, &amp;c.

                  <p>Yet the≈øe put the Lawyers al≈øo upon hard ≈øhifts; for now the Office of an Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is to practice all the parts of a Lawyer; he drawes all pleas, or generally all but ≈øome ≈øpeciall ones upon ≈øome difficult point; and in that ≈øome one old beaten book-man in a County is famous; but for making of Wills, and drawing all ≈øorts of conveyances or Covenants, with ≈øtrange niceties of form, and cautelous qualifications, limitations, provi≈øoes, and ≈øuch like, none like them; they not ≈øo much looking at their fir≈øt trading into rea≈øon, and ≈øolid cau≈øes, or grounds of things, as into the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial niceties, as the readie≈øt way to purcha≈øe practice with cunning knaves, and mo≈øt affecting wit and youth, and ≈øo are drawn into a way of evill before they be aware, and after it is hard to reclaim them; and for keeping of tho≈øe pe≈øtilences off of <hi>England,</hi> Lords Courts, they take all the work, which was heretofore the way of educating and bringing into practice the young Lawyer.</p>

                  <p>The la≈øt, is, want of ≈øharp and ≈øpeedy puni≈øhment of an offender; this makes
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105181:34"/> Orders pa≈øt the ordinary length, and infinitely beyond the rule of Ju≈øtice in Tale, above 40 Orders in a ca≈øe (Mr. <hi>Noy</hi>) or I am deceived, moved before the Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry,</hi> when he dur≈øt ≈øay, (that was Kings Attorney) my Lord I move upon the 49 Order (to my be≈øt remembrance) ≈øo that the by-word was upon a ≈øuit in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> you have gotten into a ≈øute of Buff: The≈øe things never pierced the con≈øcience of the≈øe men, they followed the example of their predece≈ø≈øors, and grew by degrees wor≈øe and wor≈øe; and thus it was al≈øo upon all other proceedings at Law in all Courts, whether upon criminal cau≈øes, or other offences again≈øt the publike or civil Laws ≈øo called, or between per≈øon and per≈øon; another evil was both in law and equity, the priviledge fir≈øt of places, then of per≈øons.</p>
                  <p>That of places partly ari≈øing from Order, ≈øo called Divine, that is, from the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ≈øimilitudinary holine≈øs of the Temple; And therefore as the Churches were in the time of Popery, and now new pleaded for Popery, as the Cities of refuge of old; and the ≈øo called Clergy ≈øtill as afore≈øaid, Idolatrou≈øly continued with us, ≈øo other places were now priviledged, and made the Sanctuaries for offenders, which were the ≈øhelter for all in≈øolencies, tumults, di≈øorders, and wickedne≈øs, which places were fir≈øt of ≈øeparate or ≈øpecial juri≈ødiction, as Cathedrals, Min≈øters, and ≈øuch other liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ari≈øing from pretended Eccle≈øia≈øtick Right and Title under the Hierarchie Papal.</p>
                  <p>The other was of the Kings Court, Lords Hou≈øes, Inns of Court and Chancery, the Seminaries as they ought to be of good Government and ≈øingular examples of order; the per≈øons priviledged were the King, who≈øe per≈øon the Laws as lately expounded had generally freed from all cen≈øure, and purged all taints by the Crown, and puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ab≈øolute Mini≈øters was laboured much again≈øt; now the rea≈øon of this was to uphold what was gained, and to gain what might be for the King; therefore the Lords as the King mu≈øt have their priviledge; and as the King mu≈øt not be ≈øued but by Petition, a Royal cheat; ≈øo the Lords mu≈øt not be arre≈øted but by prayer, a Noble flattery; but a mo≈øt grand abu≈øe aro≈øe from this; for much co≈øt did many be≈øtow to get the King, Queen, and Lords into their debt, who never gained more then undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (the recompence of foolery) by their knaveries, and multitudes of debtors and tre≈øpa≈ø≈øors bearded Law and Ju≈øtice both.</p>
                  <p>Now for Judges, Coun≈øellors, Attorneys, Lawyers of all ≈øorts, or pretenders there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the other per≈øons priviledged, they ≈øtuck together like brethren, ≈øo that hard it was to pinch them, e≈øpecially two, the Judge for his power, and the Attorney for his priviledges; but of this before ≈øufficient for the pre≈øent intention. Thus were all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in di≈øta≈øt, as to the great and principal ruling part of the Commonwealth; and head, and heart thus ≈øick, the body ≈øure was in a di≈øtemper: for all the Courts indeed, from the County Court to the Court of Pypowder, which I think is (one at lea≈øt of) the lowe≈øt, followed the track in proportion of all the tricks, quiddities, niceties of unju≈øt, dilatory and expen≈øive lawing, u≈øed in the high ≈øo called, and ≈øupream Courts of judicature.</p>
                  <p>I ≈øhall but hint the abu≈øe in Witne≈ø≈øes, there being now grown vi≈øibly many more ju≈øt exceptions again≈øt men then the old Laws allowed.</p>
                  <p>But the great evil in all Courts, was, and is, that the indeed common and mo≈øt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary que≈øtions were not determined and ≈øetled.</p>
                  <p>Matters of Accompt, matters of Covenant, which hold partly an equitable, partly a legal right, determinations of litigious que≈øtions in Wills; as in ca≈øe of a name mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtaken, in ca≈øe of a gift given to a child payable under age, who ≈øhall acquit the party that payes it; nay indeed the ancient law concerning acquittances real and per≈øonal, to me ≈øeems lo≈øt.</p>
                  <p>To ravel all and ≈øhew the utmo≈øt of ab≈øurdity, error, and perver≈øne≈øs grown upon our Courts, Lawes and Lawyers, is not by one pen to be declared; all is out of order; I will cea≈øe to tell what all know and complain of; there is nothing ≈øought but riches and honour, by what means ≈øoever; I wi≈øh the Seats of Judgement had been clear of receiving moneys, ≈øo called, Dammage clear, which ≈øhortly is thus:</p>
                  <p>A man ≈øues and recovers; now by the Law there is a ≈øuppo≈øall (and but a ≈øuppo≈øall, if that be to be ≈øuppo≈øed, which is well known to the contrary) that the Recoverer hath his debt, or his damage and co≈øts of ≈øuit; now the fir≈øt Law holding forth, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105181:34"/> looking at a kind of equity, if the ≈øuit were for ≈øo ≈ømall a matter that it exceed not 3. li. 6. s. 8. d. recovered, then it took nothing; but if it were more, then it took two ≈øhillings upon every pound. Now although I ≈øuppo≈øe at the original this was or ought to have been a ≈øufficiency to have tryed the Cau≈øe, and to be added to the Judgement, and paid by the Defendant, yet now it comes only to the Ma≈øter of the Office, who a≈ø≈øigns Co≈øts upon the Judgement, and this is paid before Execution, which the party happily never lives to ≈øee performed; this was as to a moity allowed in the Upper Bench. But in the Term, called <hi>Ea≈øter Term,</hi> 1649. it was as an oppre≈ø≈øion; taken off by the Judges; a ≈ømall beginning to a great work, but fit to operate the clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way; but is ≈øtill continued in the ≈øo called Common Pleas.</p>
                  <p>In probate of Wills, and ≈øuing out Admini≈øtrations to whom it belongs, whether accomptable, if divers children, or the wife to have all, or the elde≈øt child all, and the re≈øt nothing, with a thou≈øand other things, are ≈øo difficult in Law, though ea≈øie in Rea≈øon, as cannot but be the wonder of any one that ≈øets him≈øelfe to con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
                  <p>Now to ≈øpeak a little of the Titles by way of Feofment, or bargain and ≈øale, what a world of difficulty in them! I dare ≈øay, never a Lawyer in <hi>England</hi> can (e≈øpecially in the mo≈øt excellent tenure of the land) a≈ø≈øure to any man a good Title, neither Knight nor Lord; and all aro≈øe,</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, from the want of care in Judges authorized to enact Laws, who heard of cheatings, and yet gave no ≈øtop; for this is ≈øure, he that is able and ≈øells not for need, but for conveniency to better him≈øelf otherwhere, will not deceive gro≈øly, becau≈øe he knows it brings ≈øcandal as much as charge and trouble, though his con≈øcience be but loo≈øe; but the poor needy Prodigal, that drinks away thrift, and hardly knows, and little cares what he does, he it is that falls upon this trick, and he fir≈øt entayles, then mortgages, then ≈øells: The entayle is ≈øetled by the wives friends to ≈øecure the e≈øtate to her and her children; they keep this ≈øecret; but to keep their credit they will not borrow the money, nor commonly witne≈øs the Mortgage: Thus hath he all his deeds, and the di≈øcent appears fair or the beque≈øt, 'tis ≈øold to redeem the Mortgage, the deeds and ≈øtate; all parts from the Mortgage, and the buyer thinks him≈øelf ≈øecure, but is cheated, and the Statute of fraudulent conveyances ≈øhall not help, &amp;c. and all the recompence he hath, is the Creditors body, if he can catch it; Lands ≈øo ≈øetled, pay no debts.</p>
                  <p>Another way of cheat, is the Statute of U≈øes, ≈øetling of e≈øtates in tru≈øt to deceive, making long Lea≈øes, and ≈øuch like: This filled the world with infinite jangles; and although an ea≈øie and ≈øpeedy remedy were propo≈øed both to King <hi>James,</hi> and the late King; yet the intere≈øt of the Lawyers being now made ≈øub≈øervient to Prerogative, all was qua≈øhed; ≈øo that the Land was filled with multitudes of oppre≈ø≈øions, cruelties, cheatings, and extortions, and no remedy, and the Lawyers only enriched thereby, with the Officers of Courts, upon long, tedious and intricated controver≈øies; they were al≈øo vexed with old ≈øleeping judgements, which no time being ≈øet unto, it was the fa≈øhion to keep money in hand upon a purcha≈øe to clear incumbrances, and that kept was ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome paid; for to ≈øay there was no encomber amid ≈øo many wayes, was difficult; to ≈øwear it to no end; but to prove it impo≈ø≈øible: thus if an hone≈øt ≈øeller met with a knave a rich and contentious, or contentious buyer only, he gat it not, or ≈øo that he had as good have lo≈øt it: So for Annuities, Rents, &amp;c. Again, for conveying, there was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and ≈øei≈øin, the ≈øuppo≈øed ab≈øolute ≈øtrength, a fine, and the late pa≈ø≈øage by enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet none of the≈øe ab≈øolutely certain; for the fine though ≈øtronge≈øt, and the five years limited pa≈ø≈øed, yet if the ≈øeller had no right at the time, as many had not being neither heir, purcha≈øer, nor po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor, the fine wrought not; yet this not to be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by all the writings produced, which ≈øhewed good title; the livery voided <hi>per</hi> ≈øome prior lea≈øe, and the enrolment not done in due time: Indeed almo≈øt all good Statutes are by the loo≈øne≈øs of Judges invalidated; for ≈øo ≈øoon as hone≈øt men provide remedy again≈øt an evil pre≈øent, and emergent by act, it is the knaves work to conver≈øe with a quick brained little con≈øcienced Lawyer, and crafty Attorney, to find a loo≈øe from the Law, which is too oft allowed, and the Judge excu≈øes him≈øelf by the letter of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I ≈øhall now generally declare that the whole frame and foundation of <hi>Englands</hi> Government was loo≈øed, rotten, and vani≈øhed, which I thus manife≈øt; Look
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105181:35"/> at the Lands, and its evident, that had <hi>Noy</hi> lived, or but the Parliament been deferred, the mo≈øt con≈øiderable part of the Kingdom had been Forre≈øt; upon the claiming of which, what quick work was made in ≈øome places, few but know; that which had not been Forre≈øt to the King, would all have been ≈øecured to him by Office, as holding in Chief, or forfeiture otherwayes, either upon the chief Lords, or ≈øome inferiours want of Service: And as the King had dealt with his great men, ≈øo would they with their Tenants, whether Knights or Soccagers; but e≈øpecially the Copy-holders ≈øhould have ≈øuffered without remedy; for it was grown to this, that as no Jury dur≈øt find again≈øt the King, if a ≈øtrong conte≈øt were, that is, if it were a matter worth the ≈øtriving for (and ≈øuppo≈øed to be, or might be a flowre of the Crown) ≈øo neither dur≈øt any find again≈øt the Lord; nor indeed well could they tell how to do right, either to the Lord, or between the particular Tenants; for the Copies were generally brought to this cour≈øe, only to name ≈øo many, &amp;c. of the Tenants, R. or B. &amp;c. the Rent they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to ≈øet down, ≈øo that the Bailiff cheated the Tenant, but e≈øpecially the hone≈øt or ignorant one at his plea≈øure, and exerci≈øed more power, rather Tyranny, then a Prince; for the Fines, they generally drew them to the meer Will of the Lord, and in that were ab≈øolutely illegall; and although it was pretended the Chancery was the moderator, that was but to help the Lord; for not one man of a thou≈øand would conte≈øt; if rich, ≈øeldom but he was a Lord, for every Pea≈øant was now become the purcha≈øer of a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; if poor, the controver≈øie ruined him; Now let us a little here look at the nature of Copyholds.</p>
                  <p>Which I conceive came in thus at the Norman Conque≈øt upon the ≈øetling of his Commonwealth, as he had laid his frame, that is, that all held of the Crown mediatly or immediatly; that is they by greater ≈øervices, as Dukes, Earls, &amp;c. and the inferiour Lords of them, ≈øo all the≈øe Lords had their inferiors under them; that as they ≈øerved the King in his Wars to pre≈øerve the publique, ≈øo the≈øe might ≈øerve the nece≈ø≈øities of the ptivate Families, as Soccagers to plow, ≈øow, and cut down, &amp;c. and Villains to carry muck, and do all drudgery or meaner work, and were both but a kind of ≈øervants; the one yet more free, as having his Land, only paying his Rent, Corn, &amp;c. the other ab≈øolutely bound, over whom he had at fir≈øt power of life, and goods, and all; both yet of which, as the Nation grew civilized and religious, got more liberty and priviledge, ≈øo that they became ab≈øolutely free; and their pre≈øent conditions are ≈øo diver≈øe from pa≈øt, though the names remain, that a man will hardly believe ≈øuch things were.</p>
                  <p>Yet from the≈øe, divers har≈øh villanous Cu≈øtomes and u≈øages are ≈øtill continued; all, or any, and every of which are unrea≈øonable and unwarrantable; for the villain or bondman, his Land was his Lords, as was him≈øelf, his wife and children.</p>
                  <p>After it was given him under a Service, but he could not give nor grant; then Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices were turned into Rents, yet he had no power to di≈øpo≈øe, all was in the Lord; after the policy of the Kingdom being depraved, and the≈øe villains being grown too numerous, taking advantage of civill di≈ø≈øention among the Ma≈øters, the Servants gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the priviledge of inheritance, but not to pa≈øs it by free Deeds, or grant, or ≈øell, but to de≈øcend; at la≈øt they came to ≈øell, and u≈øage only regulated all this, and then were u≈øed as free Lands, all but the way of pa≈ø≈øing it, which matter of form is mo≈øt highly penall, even to forfeiture, and indeed the≈øe forfeitures are the ≈øole end of mo≈øt Lords.</p>
                  <p>Now the≈øe evils of forfeitures and the like, though for ≈ømall cau≈øes are grown exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing penall, mo≈øtly from the difficulties and delays of Law, but enough from the rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, unju≈øt and cruel principles of the ≈øo called Lords of Mannors, which now each greedy griping rich man is purcha≈øer of, and the value according to u≈øage ≈øet accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.

                  <p>But to return, Thus were the Ju≈øtices and all Officers made tender in execution of the Law; and thus the Law extingui≈øhed: And hence it grew, that even Felons, Murderers, and all criminous per≈øons had at la≈øt as much favor, as ba≈øene≈øs, negligence and ≈øecurity could afford; for no Hues and Cries were at all pro≈øecuted with effect; for no puni≈øhment where they cea≈øed, and the burthens of Con≈øtables in their ≈øervices were ≈øuch, and the office now put on the meane≈øt per≈øons for vexation, that little knowledge he had of his work; he ignorant, and the Law thorny, both for under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and execution, ≈øo that he onely put off the work; but to act vigorou≈øly, or with care he dur≈øt not, le≈øt his own fire ≈øhould burn his own fingers: for if he were dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and apprehended a Rogue, he was bound over ≈øometimes to pro≈øecute the Rogue or Felon for want of an Attorney for the King, or his not executing his place duly; yet all Proce≈ø≈øes were by indictment at the Kings ≈øuit, but however as a witne≈øs; and Indictings, and Recognizance Fees made them ≈øoon weary, be≈øides three or four dayes attendance, and not one penny for all their charges.

                  <p>Now that this evil is faln upon us, is evident: is it not known to all, there was no due return of Warrants by the Con≈øtables for execution of Ju≈øtice twixt man and man, but that the party mu≈øt enforce or ≈øecure the Officer, or nothing done? yea, the Sheriffs of Counties from the nicities of Laws would not execute a judgement without ≈øecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to bear harmle≈øs, rather venturing breach of oath then the rigidity of a ≈øuit.</p>

                  <p>The King having received the platform of alteration of his State from <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> he is made his Agent to keep on foot a ≈øtrong Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who, to ≈øpeak truth, were a company of men fit for as high an attempt as they were intended for, but being Je≈øuited in great, if not the greate≈øt part, they might have double de≈øigns, that is, rather to embroile all the Kingdomes, and fit them for the tooth of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> their univer≈øal Patron, then for the Kings ab≈øolute ≈øettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>England,</hi> whom they truly knew not to affect the Popes intere≈øt, further then it ≈øtood with his own, which is truly the Maxime of all Princes, however they carry it.</p>
                  <p>Upon the confidence of this Army, he is fooled into a quarrel with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and was undoubtedly made beleeve, that to let the <hi>Spaniard</hi> land 10000. in <hi>England,</hi> was the only way to ≈øet all right; and <hi>Wentworth</hi> a man of depth of policy, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, might over-confidently accept the≈øe councels; the truth I ≈øhall not prolixly a≈ø≈øert, God having providentially cut of that Quaere by the Sword of the <hi>Hollander;</hi> but their cour≈øe, lading, provi≈øion, number and quantity of men and Commanders, quality of convoy, and backs of carriage, be≈øides the te≈øtimony of divers, all tend to demon≈øtrate the ≈øame; nor for the ≈øame rea≈øon ≈øhall I argue how cro≈øs and incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent we ≈øee the≈øe Councels were; for fools ≈øee errors when the ca≈øt is plaid, which the wi≈øe Game≈øter ≈øtudied for, and could not de≈øcry: This, as it ha≈øtened preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Kings part for war, ≈øo it enforced him while yet unprepared, to hold out the En≈øigns of peace; and what no advices could produce before, is now for inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt ≈øake granted, namely, a Parliament, wherein all under-hand proceedings for ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions not being able (≈øuch a general di≈ølike being in all men to the King, and his proceedings) to work and mould it ≈øerviceable to the Kings ends, he as ≈øoon di≈ø≈øolves as calls it.</p>
                  <p>This breeding a deeper di≈øta≈øt, and he not yet fitted; and ≈øeeing the people now fell upon petitioning rather then rebelling, relying upon the Parliaments united power, rather then upon their ≈øingle per≈øonal rights, and would ≈øooner venture to ≈øet down with an unju≈øt lo≈øs of part from the Kings power, then loo≈øe all to his mercy by an unwarrantable cour≈øe,</p>
                  <p>He calls a Parliament again, and to this Parliament are brought ≈øo many complaints, that I fear the bulk of Petitions and Remon≈øtrances will affright our Worthies for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105181:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> looking into them, and let much nece≈ø≈øary work lye undone, not giving due repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to many per≈øons again≈øt publike Theeves and Extortioners; Now the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made no great ha≈øte, and the King was urgent for money: which they taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of, and of his former, not only declining and breaking up or di≈ø≈øolving Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, but his neglecting his own Laws, that is, tho≈øe to which he had a≈ø≈øented; they upon the ground laid in his third year, in≈øi≈øt to have an Act for ≈øetling this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, till di≈ø≈øolved or prorogued by them≈øelves, notwith≈øtanding an act for calling a Parliament every three years, thinking no knot too ≈øure to hold what they ≈øtill found loo≈øe; which effected, with ≈øome other things, they then fall to work with the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> that had power enough to have done all he intended in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cour≈øe of providence, had not vain confidence that he could do it when he would (as the Almighty determined) befooled him; he ≈øurprized who was the Ma≈øter-dear, the herd flye; and though accu≈øed by the Kings great Councel; yet his Maje≈øty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving affections per≈øonal, notwith≈øtanding the ≈øupream publick tru≈øt in ordinary, gives them his pa≈øs, and by the means of his Admiral, they were ≈øet ≈øafe a forreign ≈øhore; and now him≈øelf labours to his utmo≈øt the ≈øafety and pre≈øervation of that man, who had ruled in <hi>Ireland</hi> to his utmo≈øt in that ab≈øolute way he intended his Ma≈øter here ≈øhould, as the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> had done in his <hi>France;</hi> the great pleas on his ≈øide were, what he had done, was for his Ma≈øter the King, by his ≈øpecial command, for which he had his warrant, and for all Moneys, his di≈øcharge; and if a further of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence were, it was again≈øt no exi≈øtent Law; if Trea≈øon, &amp;c. not within the Law of 25. of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, which was made with much advi≈øement, to pre≈øerve the Liberty of the Subject, and con≈øequently his life by a certain knowledge of his dutie.</p>
                  <p>To which it was an≈øwered, that his tru≈øt was to the Commonwealth; to the King in his Politique, not in his natural capacity: and his per≈øonal receit, warrant, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, was not ≈øufficient, but they had power, yea in ca≈øe he had had a legal allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or di≈øcharge in ordinary, yet for the Commonwealths ≈øake which includes both king and people, to call him to an account: And to the la≈øt part that it was again≈øt no Law exi≈øtent, They ≈øaid the Parliament was by the Stat. Judge of Trea≈øon <hi>de futuro;</hi> and to orethrow the Laws and government, was more then to de≈øtroy a per≈øon: to ruine a kingdom, then kill a king; and therefore (I mu≈øt agree by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity) forced the King to a≈ø≈øent to his death; which effected, and not dared to be recalled, all plots and policies left are u≈øed to break up the Parliament, by the King; yea an attempt made upon ≈øome Members to ≈øacrifice to the Gho≈øt of <hi>Strafford;</hi> but all failing, and yet manife≈øted, the Parliament think fit to have a guard; the King practices the Army; the Parliament Vote no le≈øs then 400000. l. And with that di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band the Army; the King thus lo≈øt every way, and the Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> utterly lo≈øt by the grand Rebellion there, taking many of them part with the <hi>Iri≈øh,</hi> if not mo≈øt, and this ≈øtill giving har≈øher re≈øentments to the people, who≈øe Liberty was now grown great, and the Parliament loth to hinder them while they ≈øerved their turns, many not only ≈øleights, but affronts were put on the Kings ≈øervants, reflecting upon him≈øelf. The Bi≈øhops now ≈øhew their ≈øure Rock was he, and they wholly cleave to him; the Lords, many joyn with him, many again≈øt him, and many appear not; the Kings A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, who≈øe de≈øigns had been nipt here, being now in <hi>Denmark, Holland, France</hi> &amp;c. moved for a≈ø≈øi≈øtance again≈øt the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Rebels do there, they ≈øeek the ≈øame things, and under the ≈øame pretexts; ≈øo that the King is ≈øaid, and not without ≈øome ground, to be the chief Actor in all; ≈øo loth he was to call the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Rebels.</p>
                  <p>This cau≈øes the Parliament to talk of rai≈øing Armes, not only to defend them≈øelves again≈øt the King, and tho≈øe with whom he came to the Parliament Hou≈øe, and kept ≈øtill about him, being generally a crew of Joviali≈øts, debaucht per≈øons;</p>
                  <p>But to offend ≈øuch publike forreign Enemies, as under the Kings Name ≈øhould be brought from other Nations, or rai≈øed here; to which there was ≈øuch an unanimous loan of all ≈øorts, e≈øpecially the Religious, who found a change indeed in their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That they from that took the hint of the ≈øtrong affections of the people towards them; and upon that Vote the extirpation of Epi≈øcopacy, the which the King ≈øo long contending for, and ≈øo eagerly, ruined him≈øelf with them. How far this is to be read out of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> I ≈øhall not quaere; but ≈øay, it was long foretold out of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈øy,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105181:38"/> and now fell out; they gave them≈øelves now to treat of Reformation of the Church; but this rooting up Epi≈øcopacy took many from them; they had voted and acted again≈øt pluralities, as to ≈øettle the Church, and gave the Judges a ≈øetled and ≈øufficient ≈øalary, pretending to take away all other Fees from them, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not.</p>
                  <p>The King fled from <hi>London;</hi> the Convocation they follow his ≈øhaddow, the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament call them≈øelves a certain number of men called Mini≈øters from all parts, and nominate them the A≈ø≈øembly; the≈øe ≈øit as the Clergy of <hi>England;</hi> the King, after many Traver≈øes, having gotten together an Army, comes to <hi>Oxford,</hi> whether many come from the Parliament to him, as well as went with him; there he erects or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes a new Parliament. And by their advice, as his Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> demands Treaty with his Parliament at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> which they reject; and at la≈øt the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. <hi>London</hi> indeed ≈øtood true to them, which by its Vicinity to the Parliament, and infinite populacy, awed all other parts; they had a ≈øence of former ≈øufferings under the power of Kings; they had a deep ≈øence of the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities the godly and mo≈øt piou≈øly affected people ≈øuffered in all parts of the Nation; and how far the vicinity of the Court, and Archbi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> had violated their Chri≈øtian Liberty, prevailing over the quiet ≈øpirit of their Bi≈øhop, was though little, not forgotten; they therefore generally followed the Parliament, e≈øpecially ≈øtirred up by their Mini≈øters, as having in hand the cau≈øe of God: The King he brands them all with Declarations of Rebellion, and taxing them with ≈øeeking his life, and the rooting out of his Po≈øterity.</p>
                  <p>They an≈øwer, that they were ≈øo far from ≈øeeking his life, as that they ≈øhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, by all means po≈ø≈øible, to defend and protect the ≈øame, their ju≈øt Rights and Priviledges pre≈øerved; and for his ≈øatisfaction cau≈øe the Nation generally to enter the like Prote≈øtation; this not ≈øatisfying, but it being ≈øtill urged by the King, that the Prote≈øtation was but to e≈øtabli≈øh their own power, not ≈øecure his fears;</p>
                  <p>While their Armies were in the field again≈øt the King; they an≈øwered, They were only on the defen≈øive part; and ≈øuch indeed was the Generals Commi≈ø≈øion; and that they could not but according to their tru≈øts pre≈øerve the Laws and Rights of the Nation: Hereupon they open the Law, that the King was indeed but the chief tru≈øted per≈øon, and that for his peoples ≈øake; that of this not he only, but they al≈øo, and more e≈øpecially being congregate into a body were to judge, that his failings pa≈øt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate, his ends contrary to publike intere≈øt, and re≈øolve that even the Law of Nature taught ≈øelf-pre≈øervation, and that it was too too vi≈øible he intended an u≈øurpation upon their ju≈øt Priviledges.</p>
                  <p>That they de≈øired his pre≈øervation, ≈øo it might con≈øi≈øt with the Weal-publick; and therefore de≈øired him to leave the company of evill men (≈øo called his Coun≈øellors) who mi≈ø-led him, and to adhere to his great Councel, and promi≈øed to make him on the≈øe terms the mo≈øt Glorious King that ever was in the≈øe Nations; and now a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe part appearing upon ≈øeveral grounds and opinions amid the Members of the Hou≈øe, the prevailing party to firm the union betwixt the <hi>Scots</hi> and them more ≈øtrongly, who≈øe a≈ø≈øi≈øtance they had had all this while in the work, they frame a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which held forth ≈øecurity and glory to the King and his po≈øterity, in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ≈øettle Church and State upon the firm foundations of Ju≈øtice and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs, which taken in <hi>Scotland</hi> is tran≈ømitted hither, and they by Parliament made brethren; and this is tendred to the King to ≈øign, being fir≈øt taken ≈øolemnly by the principal of the Nation, with this condition.</p>
                  <p>That if the King agreed with them in it, they would ≈øtill not only acknowledge him their King, but make him more glorious, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But this was ≈øo penned in ≈øuch general terms, that an ab≈øolute Royali≈øt might well take it; for it was intended by the ≈øome, I ≈øay not the many, by the leaders, not the followers, but as a mea≈øure to try the ≈øtretch of every mans judgement, opinion, or intere≈øt; many no doubt took it cordially, many formally, ≈øome ≈øtrictly, ≈øome loo≈øely; but though this were not only taken but urged; yet Armies were continued again≈øt the King (as he ≈øaid) in the field, again≈øt his evil Councel, as they ≈øaid; 'tis truth, their evil Councel was now his, the Le≈ø≈øon of ab≈øolute power, and to be like his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; the re≈øt of the Kings who had joyned intere≈øt with the Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> made him not only hold corre≈øpondence with that Bea≈øt, not only at bed and board, but
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105181:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> Councel al≈øo, as far as ≈øerved his intere≈øt, who undoubtedly aimed to rule in all things according to his own Will, which Will, yet, ≈øhould have had Regulations; but ≈øtill with ≈øuch dependence upon his Judgement, that he being the ≈øpeaking Law, would have had no Interpreter that ≈øhould be able to cro≈øs him and his determination: and ≈øo the Law mu≈øt have ≈øpoken in all things to his lu≈øt, or he would have made it; and this he thought, and I am per≈øwaded believed to be the undoubted right of all Princes; though their people as his in ca≈øe of conte≈øt between competitors for the Soveraignty might wring ≈øomething from them of Grants or Charters, or ≈øo called priviledges or immunities, which yet he believed they could no more grant to the prejudice of the Crown, that is, of the heirs and ≈øucce≈ø≈øors in the Kingdom, then things ≈øacred to God could be imployed to prophane u≈øes.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine admitted, which I dare avow was, and can prove ≈øufficiently by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øes yet alive, That our late King <hi>Charls</hi> ≈øaid the≈øe words openly upon a Hearing. (Mr. <hi>Hern,</hi> I have heard what you have ≈øaid; What do you talk to me of Law, Ju≈øtice, or Con≈øcience? (according to all which Mr. <hi>Herne</hi> alledged the Patent ≈øigned by his Maje≈øty to be) I tell you, ≈øaid the King, there is nothing in <hi>England</hi> ≈øhall ≈øtand that is not for my profit; There ≈øtands one (pointing to Sir <hi>John Banks,</hi> then Attorney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, who had hundred of pounds, many I have heard for the work, and drew the Patent) ≈øhall bring a <hi>quo warranto</hi> again≈øt the Patent, and ≈øee then what you will do.</p>
                  <p>Now take notice this Patent was of the new invention of Salt, and oppo≈øed the Monopoly at the Sheilds under the favor of de≈øervedly beheaded <hi>Hambleton,</hi> and the Inventor not complying with the Kings Intere≈øt again≈øt the priviledge of the Subject, the King brake not onely his private word with him, contrary to particular engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under his Hand, carried by Sir <hi>Charls Herbert,</hi> but al≈øo his publike word as King; this ≈øentence being ≈øo ruinous to the man, made the Worme ≈øpeak, and ≈øaid, Sir, Dare you be a King and be thus unju≈øt! I never read of Tyrant ≈øaid ≈øo, what ever he did (or words of like effect;) whereupon Lord <hi>Dorcet,</hi> with a great oath (by his Maker, as I expre≈øs it) ≈øaid, loe (and if it plea≈øe your Maje≈øty) the≈øe are your prick-eared Rogues, the Tub-preachers (and indeed he was a Zealot) the≈øe are they will pluck you out of your Throne, unle≈øs you dethrone them.</p>
                  <p>I pray take not this Lord for a Prophet, unle≈øs like <hi>Caiaphas.</hi> This word I could not but in≈øert for con≈øcience ≈øake, as a firm Index and te≈øtimony of his reall intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; This kept him off from clo≈øing with his Parliament, and the rather becau≈øe they in≈øi≈øted to have the Sword in their power for ≈øo many years, or during his life; tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of him cau≈øed the Parliament to venture far; for it could not by this ≈øole defen≈øive way, but protract the war, di≈øcourage the ≈øouldier, and in fine ruine them, giving the King time to rai≈øe new forces at all times, if they could not gain his per≈øon; and this experience taught them ≈øo, that after many cumbats, their Armies ≈øtreighted and broken in great part, their full pur≈øes being profu≈øely clean emptied; for who being an Engli≈øh man did they think would have oppo≈øed the power of the Nation for a ≈øole per≈øons ≈øake? but by the ju≈øt hand of God, and to bring to puni≈øhment ≈øuch offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as the legal ≈øword would never reach, he inclines mens hearts to follow the King, mo≈øt of them yet Papi≈øts or meer formal Prote≈øtants and debaucht ones; the generality of the ≈øo called Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy e≈øpecially all in honor, or that bowed to that Idol; among them were al≈øo many men of very tender con≈øcience, zealous of truth, and performing (at lea≈øt to men) righteou≈øne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>On the other ≈øide were at fir≈øt all the vulgar, all men generally eying God in his wayes of providence, poor de≈øpicable creatures, yet full of faith and knowledge; the≈øe were of ≈øeveral opinions concerning God, his Names, Attributes, E≈ø≈øence, our Saviour, the holy Spirit, his ≈øervice, their own duty, publike and private, that is, their duty to God, and one to another.</p>
                  <p>But two e≈øpecially were powerful in adherents, The one called the Presbyterian, the other the Independent; the main differences twixt which I ≈øhall, as far as I can here, ≈øuccinctly lay down, not upon their nice critical di≈øtinctions as Schollars ≈øo called, but in the plain way of rational difference. Now truly I ≈øee no difference as to the points of faith; they acknowledge both the Father, Son and holy Gho≈øt, the end of the Sons mi≈ø≈øion, to offer ≈øalvation to all, but effect it onely to tho≈øe believe on him, whom he hath elected before the world began, in due time calls, and at la≈øt ≈øaves, not for their
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105181:39"/> works ≈øake, or ought in them, but as he elected them, not becau≈øe of fore≈øight of works, but of his free grace, ≈øo he ≈øaves them; that good works and obedience to the Law, are the outward Te≈øtimonies of a Chri≈øtian, but not infallible, for the Law condemns, no ne can perform it; That Chri≈øt onely ju≈øtifies.</p>
                  <p>They indeed ≈øeem to differ about obedience to what Law; the Presbyterian having ≈øtill an eye to the at lea≈øt equity of the Judicials; but I pre≈øume if throughly examined, ea≈øie to be reconciled: Their main differences then one would think might be ea≈øily determined, but they are thought va≈øt and irreconcileable, and they are the≈øe:</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, whether an outward and vi≈øible ≈øucce≈ø≈øion derivative, not onely from the Doctrine of the Apo≈øtles, but al≈øo from their calling, ≈øo ≈øuppo≈øed, is of nece≈ø≈øity to the true Church, which is really the ≈øame difference betwixt the Presbyterian and Bi≈øhop, and Bi≈øhop and Papi≈øt; the Papi≈øt urging it again≈øt the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> reforming Bi≈øhop, and ≈øo the Bi≈øhop again≈øt the pre≈øent Reforming Presbyterian, and the Presbyterian a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Independent ≈øo called; now the plain Que≈øtion hath this involved difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in it, as I conceive;</p>
                  <p>That is, what nece≈ø≈øity of impo≈øition of Hands? for if it doth confer Grace, an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtolike vertue being tyed to the Succe≈ø≈øors of Bi≈øhops, Prie≈øts, Deacons upon that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe of Chri≈øt, <hi>What ever ye bind on earth,</hi> &amp;c. or <hi>I will be with you to the end of the world;</hi> or inclu≈øively from the effect of impo≈øition, That they receive the holy Gho≈øt; then it is of nece≈ø≈øity; but if it be but declarative of the de≈øignation of the per≈øon to the office of the Mini≈øtery, then it is not of nece≈ø≈øity, unle≈øs ≈øpecially commanded, which wil al≈øo here ≈øhortly determine the bu≈øine≈øs of Confimation of Infants, which may ≈øeem to have war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thus far in Chri≈øtian Congregations, That men and women baptized Infants, and after they come to age, walking blamele≈øly, may and ought openly before the admi≈ø≈øion to the Ordinance of the Lords Supper, be examined by the Pa≈øtor, the Congregation, or ≈øuch as will pre≈øent, concerning the hope of their ≈øalvation, which allowed to pray for the ble≈ø≈øings of the Lord upon them, and to confirm and ≈øtrengthen them in this faith, I believe is, and will be acknowledged, and duly practi≈øed in covenient time.</p>
                  <p>And la≈øt, and in chief the Independent hold forth the particular Rights of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregations; that is, each Congregation is ≈øubject to no other head but Chri≈øt in the things of Chri≈øt; that is, to govern it ≈øelf according to the Scripture, without any ≈øuperintendencie of one or more per≈øons, or Churches ≈øo called, that is, Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Chri≈øtians.</p>
                  <p>The Presbyterian differs upon this, as holding forth no order, but introductive of an ab≈øolute confu≈øion: Now the rea≈øon of this high judgement, is indeed upon very high con≈øequences, which rather the practi≈øes then the principles of the Independents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare: for let the Presbyterian ≈øpeak out, and he ≈øaith, the Independent razes the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Church Government ≈øeveral ways; and to profe≈øs the truth, their Tenents tend to thus much and no more, nor otherwi≈øe de≈øtroying Government or order;</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Rome</hi> is My≈øtical <hi>Babylon</hi> literally; That all the Nations, Provinces, and Kingdoms who partake of the fornication of that ≈øpiritual Whore, that is, walk upon her ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, ≈øhall partake with her in her plagues; that this Cup which is in her hand, all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, at lea≈øt called Chri≈øtian, have drunk deep of; That the ≈øo called Mini≈øtry of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> holding no Call but the outward, or that principally, and this derived from, or by the corrupted Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> is no true Mini≈øtry, or at lea≈øt not the true Mini≈øtry; That neither are the ≈øo called Lords Bi≈øhops, nor the domineering Cla≈ø≈øis of Elders, whether Parochial or Provincial, the officers of the Church, warranted in Scripture for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øignation of Pa≈øtoral duty or ability, That re≈øting in the whole Church, or community of believers gathered into Congregations; That all of them being corrupted, nay, lo≈øt both in Doctrine and Di≈øcipline, are to be gathered anew; all that are in the Pari≈øhes, though holding forth the profe≈ø≈øion of Chri≈øt, yet walking clean contrary, are not by the power of Bapti≈øm, or that Covenant (implicite, that is, being bound not by their own words, but the confe≈ø≈øion and ingagements of others) ab≈øolutely in the Church, and ≈øo to have right to the Ordinances of the la≈øt Supper; but that before they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they ought to give ≈øatisfaction to the Church (that is, that company of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to which they ≈øhall joyn them≈øelves) of their faith, and the hope they have of their ≈øalvation, and walking accordingly; and the≈øe are hence (ju≈øtly) called tho≈øe of the Congregational way, commonly called Independents.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the Presbyterian holds the ≈øame with the Bi≈øhop in every point, onely the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105181:40"/> per≈øon of the Bi≈øhop, as the Head or Angel of the Church, is he in whom, ≈øaith the Bi≈øhop, the power of the Church ≈øpecially re≈øts, and the great tru≈øts of Ordination, and Confirmation, and ≈øo Excommunication.</p>
                  <p>The Presbyterians ≈øay in the Elder≈øhip.</p>
                  <p>The Independent in the whole Congregation.</p>
                  <p>It is truth, the≈øe things were and are otherwi≈øe received by the vulgar and multitude: The Independent ≈øo called, being burthened, both by Bi≈øhop and Presbyterian with all calumnies; as the Presbyterian being envied much by the Bi≈øhop, being as his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and by all their followers; and that ju≈øt as the Papi≈øts had in the fir≈øt Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion branded the Church ≈øo called of <hi>England,</hi> governed by Bi≈øhops, but denying the Supremacy of the Pope, and therefore cur≈øed by them as Hereticks, Schi≈ømaticks, Adulterers, yea Heathens; for by their rule we had no Mini≈øtry, no Sacraments, and ≈øo con≈øequently no Church, becau≈øe not holding of their head the Pope.</p>
                  <p>And in the word of a Chri≈øtian, ≈øo doth the con≈øequence of the Epi≈øcopal and Pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Doctrine brand the Congregational way; for they ≈øay, no Mini≈øtry but ≈øo derived as by Succe≈øsion from the Apo≈øtles; and that admitted, they mu≈øt hold none have power to admini≈øter the Sacraments. They all differ al≈øo about Government in the Church; the Bi≈øhop and Presbyterian much what alike, both indeed making the officers of the Church the Church, as <hi>Rome</hi> doth; ≈øo as the Church taking the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ≈øolely into them≈øelves, count all other Chri≈øtians as Lay-men; they had as good ≈øay Heathens; if throughly ≈øcanned, and they onely the Clergy, the Prie≈øts of the living God, &amp; ≈øo indeed claim a magi≈øterial power by the ≈øame Rules, Order, Arguments, and Di≈øtinctions and Differences, as <hi>Rome</hi> doth, yea, over the Supream Magi≈øtrate, making him their rod of iron to thre≈øh the Nations, that is, all oppo≈øers of their Cla≈øsical Edicts: The≈øe men gave the Magi≈øtrate no more power then the Pope; for as he, ≈øo they were the Church, the holy ones, the Saints, at lea≈øt repre≈øentative.</p>
                  <p>To the≈øe, men at fir≈øt gave great regard; but many wi≈øe Heathen Lay-men feared the≈øe mens unskilful lording it over the Lords Inheritance; for they pre≈øumed the≈øe ra≈øh Novices in civil Di≈øcipline would drive higher then the Bi≈øhops, who had gone before them; Surely, if the Bi≈øhops, men trained up at the Courts of Princes, after they came out of the Halls of Lords (for the Chaplains of great men came generally to Epi≈øcopal Thrones or Chairs) and ≈øo had ≈øtill had a reflection upon the order of civil Government, and had undoubtedly improved their natural, as well as ≈øo called ≈øpiritual Talent, if they had lo≈øt them≈øelves, and ruined Government, through error in Judgement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or dependance: what would the≈øe who came but from the Pedantical Tyranny of the Univer≈øities, and fooli≈øh idioti≈øms of <hi>puer-putes?</hi> I intend this to meer Scholars, and give them but their own language, which I pre≈øume they cannot but apprehend.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe con≈øiderations made the Parliament at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> while yet un≈øhattered otherwi≈øe then by defection (ba≈øe unworthy defection! they ≈øhould as men have had re≈øolutions worthy their tru≈øts; but their cau≈øe, it ≈øeems, gave no courage at fir≈øt) to declare again≈øt the≈øe powers of Pari≈øhional Presbyteries to this effect, that they did not intend to rai≈øe nine thou≈øand odd hundred Seats of Judgement, or Judicatories; that is, ≈øo many as there were Pari≈øhes of <hi>England;</hi> the lea≈øt of which ≈øhould have more power then the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I think few men knowing but will agree, that the name onely of Bi≈øhop ≈øhould have been ≈øu≈øpended or extingui≈øhed, but the ≈øame power, yea, that ≈øo called by the Presbyter unju≈øt, being exerci≈øed by the Bi≈øhop, the preheminence being now in the Presbytery, the ≈øame had been allowed; and indeed it plea≈øed God ≈øo farto give way, that the≈øe men were throughly tryed; for the Parliament did (not ≈øeeing all at once) con≈øtitute Elder≈øhips to be cho≈øen, and improved ≈øome men, whether intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as ≈øuppo≈øing that Di≈øcipline be≈øt, or ≈øo called, politickly to di≈øcover their temper, I determine not.</p>
                  <p>But the≈øe men pre≈øently fall hot upon the work, and what had but ju≈øt before ruined their predece≈ø≈øors the Bi≈øhops, and been their ≈øtumbling ≈øtone, namely the Non-Conformity of the now called Presbyter, becomes the Presbyters rock of offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the ≈øo now called Independents: And to a≈ø≈øure this, after the manner of the Apo≈øtate Church, they call for the ≈øecular power (or the power of the ≈øecular Sword) and an Act was ≈øaid to be prepared, they talked much of it.</p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:105181:40"/>
                  <p>That Non-Conformi≈øts ≈øhould have a liberty to bear office, either in Church or Commonwealth: It is truth, the rigidity of ≈øome its probable, ≈øeeking not onely the Supremacy of power, but an addition of wealth, for by them al≈øo were ≈øought outward honor, riches, Lay-power ≈øo called, and what el≈øe was of the old Babels tra≈øh to adorn the Church, and by them called the Churches Rights, bounding it to the ≈øo called Prie≈øthood, was by the≈øe as much eyed as by the verie≈øt <hi>Babylonian</hi> in the world, and the Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> ≈øtill made the Stalking-hor≈øe to their lucre; and the ba≈øe men of a rout of people, ≈øo called al≈øo <hi>Cleri</hi> or Clergy men, in whom, if St. <hi>Paul</hi> left the Qualifications right ≈øet down, were rather the Prie≈øts of <hi>Bacchanals</hi> if not of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> then Pa≈øtors of rightly con≈øtituted Congregations; and the≈øe altogether take advantage of an Ordinance made for Tythes to give the denied treble damages; they al≈øo upon the ≈øame grounds, get Acts, Orders or Ordinances for uniting Pari≈øhes, and could inform untruths for advantage, which appearing, the union is for malice, not con≈øcience of the complainer di≈ø≈øolved; for could the per≈øecutor have had his Tythes but for half value, all had been whi≈øt, but the Prie≈øt ≈øaw not where ≈øuch agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would re≈øt; he might undo the Church, that is, his Succe≈ø≈øor by that means.</p>
                  <p>Wills Probation fixed as they were under an incertain irregular way and illegal, till e≈øtabli≈øhed; they continued the Marriage of per≈øons (as a Sacrament) to be the proper work of the Prie≈øts; Baptizing Infants the eighth day, held, if not by the wi≈øe≈øt, yet by the mo≈øt, of nece≈ø≈øity to ≈øalvation.</p>
                  <p>Yea, ≈øome held, That the Sacrament of the Lords Supper was a converting Ordinance, and ≈øo to be admini≈øtred to all to whom the Go≈øpel was to be preached, namely the mo≈øt prophane of any.</p>
                  <p>This to many ≈øeemed rather an allowance Politick, then Religious, to gain a party then to give forth a principle, untill ≈øome leaders were found publickly to avow the Tenent; but this licentiou≈øne≈øs lo≈øt them the be≈øt and mo≈øt con≈øiderable party. I ≈øhall not further wade in the≈øe Controver≈øies, nor had I gone thus far, could I have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes well cleared what is to follow;</p>
                  <p>Namely, that the Magi≈øtrate eyed the≈øe Tenets, as ≈øorting with or again≈øt his intere≈øt, and accordingly ≈øeemed to allow or di≈øallow; The Presbyter ≈øtruck ≈øo high at the root of Magi≈øtracy, making them their meer Executioners, and bringing by Text of old Law what was given to the Prie≈øts more imperiou≈øly into the <hi>Cleri;</hi> and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øide, the ≈øo called <hi>Era≈øtian,</hi> giving all to the Magi≈øtrate, not as of the Church, or in the Church, but meerly from the Civil Juri≈ødiction, and totall ≈øubjection of the whole cour≈øe of ≈øo called Prie≈øts unto the meer will of the Magi≈øtrate, either by doing or ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, not allowing an equitable di≈øpute, as both were thought be≈øt to be at pre≈øent rejected.</p>
                  <p>Now the ≈øo called Independent, or rather Congregational party, walking in the mean, what ever the vulgar e≈øteemed them, and how Idiot-like and ≈øimply they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of them; yet the moderate and inqui≈øitive found in their Doctrine, more of the purity and ≈øimplicity of the Doctrine of Chri≈øt, then either of the other held forth; namely, Bi≈øhop or Presbyter: yea, no ≈øuch infallibility by them pretended to, as both the other were guilty of, the≈øe holding that though there was all the revealed Will of God manife≈øted in the Scriptures, yet that all was not di≈øcovered to the world, much le≈øs received by it all at once; but that the Wi≈ødom of God unveiled him≈øelf, and gave out to every Age their portion.</p>
                  <p>The Examples they gave were clear as day, in the great manife≈øtations God had given the world in the≈øe latter times from <hi>Luther</hi> to his followers, from them to <hi>Calvin,</hi> from him to this pre≈øent; and therefore they propounded, That the Rule of Gods Word held forth many things that to this Age ≈øeemed clear, yet a future might de≈øcry doubts in, &amp; therefore they advi≈øed moderation to be u≈øed towards men of all opinions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning matters of Religion of all ≈øorts, and ≈øo held forth the propo≈øition of liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, but not as agreeing that each man might do what him lu≈øt, or live at his own law.</p>
                  <p>But that as no man knew the Father, but he to whom the Son revealed him, nor the Son but by the Father, that is, the communication of the work of grace was ≈øolely from the immediate hand of the Almighty; That man not di≈øobeying the Law Civil, that is, the proper Law of the Magi≈øtrate, as man, That the Civil Sword or Sword of Civil Ju≈øtice reached not the life of any man, no not his e≈øtate, that is, had no ju≈øt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over a man for what was only meer matter of religion, that is of pure con≈øcience;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105181:41"/> That is, to ≈øpeak to the mo≈øt mens under≈øtanding, that the Magi≈øtrate was not (at lea≈øt ≈øo the Keeper of both Tables, as) to enforce an outward obedience to the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion he held forth; the pre≈øident of error manife≈øt was in the divers ≈øounds of the Trumpets of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth, James</hi> and <hi>Charls,</hi> all various, ≈øome contrary; this ≈øummed up drew from contrary affected ones, whether from intere≈øt, evil affection, or ignorance, two charges.</p>
                  <p>One of confu≈øion ≈øo called, by affecting toleration for all opinions, yea even to community of wives and e≈øtates, afterwards called Levelling.</p>
                  <p>The other of new Lights, as if they had been meerly ≈øceptical, that is, ready every hour, at every change of intere≈øt, or whim≈øey of the crown, by a prophetick phanta≈øy to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a change of at lea≈øt religious principles.</p>
                  <p>I have been in company with them, who after bitter invectives again≈øt Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents (yea I may atte≈øt ≈øome of the black cloath) have upon the opening of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, approved their enemies, and di≈øallowed their own parties, profe≈ø≈øing to have taken up the controver≈øie but on tru≈øt; however the opinion of the ≈øo called Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent agreed with the temper of the civil Magi≈øtrate, as by him thought mo≈øt ≈øuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yet not of nece≈ø≈øity to the power by them intended, which was regulated De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracie, as the King held Epi≈øcopacy be≈øt, as mo≈øt ≈øutable to Monarchy; and the Presbyterian affected the (Lords) (however degenerated) as ≈øorting be≈øt with Ari≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracie now corrupted: Now the≈øe parties, though they held forth principles diver≈øe, yea ≈øome ≈øeemingly contrary, while the power of the King was on foot, yet they fell not right out; many Independents looking at the outward letter of the Covenant took it; ≈øome fearing, denyed it; but this bred hot di≈øputes, and though it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as afore≈øaid, as a meer civil touch≈øtone for the Commonwealths ≈øettlement, yet from the different Intere≈øt of parties it was di≈øobliged; but e≈øpecially after the ≈øence was explained; and that ≈øo far from the pure natural acception of the letter, for in≈øtance, that clau≈øe to labour uniformity, &amp;c, according to the Word of God, and the example of the be≈øt Reformed Churches, which was interpreted of <hi>Scotland</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally by the party.</p>
                  <p>This being on foot, and the Parliaments party brought low under the Earl of <hi>E≈ø≈øex,</hi> the Defen≈øive General; The Parliament had now found out a man, I may ≈øay God ≈øent them one, though of Noble extraction in the worlds phra≈øe, that is, born of rich parents, yea anciently rich, who would take an Offen≈øive Commi≈øsion; for it is ≈øaid <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> would not; the Commons were eager, but the Lords oppo≈øed this, by this time re≈øenting, their Intere≈øt al≈øo hung upon the ≈øame chain with the Kings; but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking was proceeded in too far to be ≈øtopped, ≈øo that on they go, and now in a mi≈øerable low condition, they re≈øolve to new mould the Army, a work ≈øo improper and impertinent, both in regard of di≈øta≈øting old Commanders, and getting new mutinies of old Souldiers, not willing to change a General until all ≈øcores be cleared, as well as getting new, when on the lo≈øing, nay lo≈øt ≈øide, and that ob≈øtructed with ≈øtain of Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>But all the≈øe bugs pa≈øt a≈øide, it is ordered, and accordingly done; but there is a rub ca≈øt in the way by the brethren of <hi>Scotlands</hi> friends; for it is ordered none to bear office in the Army that ≈øhould not take the Covenant; yet this all this while held forth as a religious Oath, a Covenant to God, and from thence urged to the end of civil ≈øettlement; and at la≈øt it went ≈øo high, that no one ≈øhould bear Office Eccle≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øtick ≈øo called, Civil, or Military, that would not ≈øubject his con≈øcience to this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which as I have ≈øaid few men literally oppo≈øed, but ob≈øtructed with the late <hi>Scotti≈øh</hi> mi≈øt of interpretation or explanation but as occa≈øion offered; this al≈øo was not ≈øo pre≈ø≈øed as to retard the work which now pre≈ø≈øed hard upon them; ≈øo that it was reported divers of the Members thought the Seats at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter</hi> too hot; for <hi>Leice≈øter</hi> taken, and the King with his Army coming on full and ≈øtrong, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's weak and thin, all was counted lo≈øt: I my ≈øelf the day the field of <hi>Na≈øeby</hi> was fought, dined with four of the Honors ≈øo called, of Knight-Baronets, and two Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels under the Earl of <hi>Manche≈øter,</hi> who avowed there were but two Souldiers in the Field, the General, and Major General; <hi>Cromwel</hi> was known ab≈øent, and the outlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øh Game≈øter <hi>Vermuden</hi> gone, when tide turned, he had lately laid down; which made them ≈øay, had they one thou≈øand pound, they would not be in the Battaile for nine hundred, ≈øo lo≈øt was the Cau≈øe given; yet a Noble Knight, though highly affected to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105181:41"/> the Intere≈øt both of <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> and <hi>Manche≈øter</hi> re≈øolved, he had rather lo≈øe his 1000. l. there, then have it, and life, and liberty taken away.</p>
                  <p>To this de≈øpicable Army in ≈øuch a ≈øea≈øon and juncture of time, as there never was the like for ≈øtrength of all ≈øorts on the other ≈øide, (as in all Battails before) after a lo≈øs of the day in the wi≈ødom and power of mans ≈øtrength) did the Lord give ≈øuch a ≈øignall Victory, as being wi≈øely followed and improved, the Kings party were never able to make head again; but their ≈øeverall parties in the ≈øeverall Counties, were, partly by the <hi>Scot,</hi> keeping them on work by diver≈øions; The <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Generall, neither Winter nor Summer gave any ≈øtop, till <hi>England</hi> had but two Armies, the mercinary ≈øo called of <hi>Scots,</hi> and the other of <hi>Engli≈øh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the King, <hi>Oxford</hi> now only left unto him, was enforced to try his then la≈øt ≈øhift, namely to betake him≈øelf to the <hi>Scot,</hi> having a ≈øtrong Army before <hi>Newark,</hi> thereby to engage a quarrel, as is more then evident to all; by whom he is pre≈øently upon the ≈øurrender of the place, carried back to <hi>New-Ca≈øtle,</hi> and they wi≈øely finding the difficulties attending them, in ca≈øe they ≈øhould carry him per≈øonally into <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon a Treaty deliver him up to the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> and what was altogether unexpected, return into their own Land, what engagements to a return I know not: And now the Presbyterian party ≈øo called, fly high indeed, and urge execution to the highe≈øt of the ≈øettlement of their own Intere≈øt, &amp; having no other publick enemy, bandy again≈øt their brethren in the Lords War; the generality of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> was for them; the ≈øo called Independents, being e≈øteemed by the many, as the Chri≈øtians of old, actors of all impurities, and their fry of Confederates the Sectaries, but as ≈øo many legions of Divels, ≈øent into the world to give a ≈øtop to the erection of the glorious Kingdom of the Lord Chri≈øt Je≈øus; and ≈øure ≈øome in their zeal would have thought they had done God good ≈øervice to have killed them.</p>
                  <p>I can in my private thoughts compare their condition to none better, then that of the <hi>I≈øraelites,</hi> when they had the Sea before them, and an Army behind them, and were in the wilderne≈øs; I know the pa≈ø≈øion of many a ≈øoul, when after all their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails for Liberty, from the yoak ≈øo called of the Bi≈øhops Tyranny, they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves ground to powder under the Mil≈øtone of the Presbyters Rigidity, and all this for con≈øcience ≈øake; for the Presbyter began according to the old Rule with Church work, and that was and ever will be long work; e≈øpecially where men take it upon them without the Lord, the builder builds in vain.</p>
                  <p>From this the Commonwealth being ≈øtill as over-burthened as before, the di≈øta≈øtes were great again≈øt the pre≈øent Governors; ≈øtill as before the galled back ≈øeeks ea≈øe, let the plai≈øter, cover, or ≈øaddle be not only gilt, but gold; This opens a way to the oppre≈ø≈øed for the righteous and ju≈øt ends of the undertaking of this war being held forth, that the ends of the Covenant, as looking at Gods glory, the peoples good, and the ju≈øt Rights of the King were not ever intended to be denyed; but the pretended ends, namely thereby to en≈ønare the con≈øciences of men by ≈øelf-ended glo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, or the bani≈øhing their per≈øons, and confi≈øcation of their goods, not for neglect of civil obedience, but not conforming to the opinion of others, when as yet it was profe≈ø≈øed, that grace was the free gift of God, that the rules of prudence or earnall policy had no ground in Gods Word; if prudence only might rule, why not the Popes and Bi≈øhops as well as the Presbyters? and to enforce con≈øcience with the Sword of the <hi>Scot</hi> was as evil as the Mace of a <hi>German.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The≈øe and the like matters di≈øper≈øed abroad, and e≈øpecially in the Army, ≈øome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments rowze, and head, and notwith≈øtanding all po≈øsible endeavors of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both at <hi>London</hi> and in the Counties, the whole Army is fixed, and both with life and Armes meet at the Rendezvouz, and engage to pro≈øecute the ju≈øt ends of Liberty, or to obtain the ju≈øt Liberty of the people (and hereabout the name of Levellers fir≈øt aro≈øe) part of the Army actually ≈øeize the Kings per≈øon at <hi>Holmby,</hi> and now the active Grandees of the ruling party, ≈øo called Presbyterian, are accu≈øed of high Trea≈øon.</p>
                  <p>The King is under the cu≈øtody of the Army, and all means endeavoured, I beleeve, to make him in≈øtrumentall to the ends propounded to them≈øelves; how far their Treaty proceeded, or what obligations were on either ≈øide, were and are to me pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; I can take them to be but politick Tran≈øactions with re≈øpects to their mutuall

                  <p>But to proceed, there was much ≈øpoken now of the <hi>Scots</hi> return, and many agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a great body was enforced to attend the King: And he of a politique head was much catching and drawing; and it is likely that his great knowledge, where he met with true con≈øcience, not equally gifted, he mu≈øt prevail; for prevention of which and other evils, he I beleeve by ≈øtratagem and over-reach, was brought to carry him≈øelf into the I≈øle of <hi>Wight,</hi> where five hundred could do more then ten thou≈øand otherwhere; but ≈øee, this brings greater preplexities; for many now wearied with war, and its effects of all ≈øorts, or ≈øo pretending, taking advantage of the Armies op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing of disbanding, cry out, there can be no peace while there is an Army; and though it is truth they were not a meer mercinary Army, but rai≈øed by Parliament, under the notion of engagement, as free men, for their own ju≈øt Rights: Yet it was plain their Intere≈øt was now grown wholly into the Army, and that experience ≈øhewed there could be no ju≈øt ≈øettlement while the Sword was un≈øheathed, That they intended nothing but to take away property, and introduce confu≈øion, and were Levellers, haters of all Ju≈øtice; ≈øo that now the Souldier was enforced to ≈øtand upon his own guard; <hi>London</hi> was oppo≈øite, her Trade was decayed, her A≈ø≈øe≈øsments great, and all places filled with complaints; The weaker party in Parliament being ≈øedulous and crying up the Common good, got not only many hearts, but had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven many ≈øtrong dependants into principal places of Tru≈øt and Office, both at Sea and Land; ≈øo that all that the mighty men could do, was only to plot, but they could not bring to effect: The Army was before much admired for complying with the King; and who ≈øo high again≈øt them as the Presbyter? O they treated, indeed it was the ≈øucce≈øs (however carried) they maligned; ≈øure I am, they oppo≈øed not the thing, for they acted higher in it, then ever did the other; but to prepare for the work about the eleventh of <hi>June,</hi> 1647.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>London Apprentices</hi> ≈øo called, made the foule≈øt breach unto the Liberty of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> that ever was, forcing away the Speaker, and all partaking with the Intere≈øt of the Army; and the re≈øidue of the Members to te≈øtifie their contrivance of the fact, choo≈øe a new Speaker; and declare them at <hi>Wind≈øor,</hi> the head-Quarters of the Army, whither the Speaker and divers Parliament men were fled, or retired, a meer <hi>Juncto</hi> (as the Parliament of <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> and the A≈ø≈øembly at <hi>Oxford</hi> had before mutually declared again≈øt each other) But by the power of the Army they are re-in≈øtated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> and declare <hi>Pelhams</hi> Parliament ≈øo called, he being the new cho≈øen Speaker, no Parliament; but the lenity of the prevailing part went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then impri≈øonment of ≈øome heads, either not daring in ≈øuch a difficult ≈øea≈øon, or prudently forbearing to exa≈øperate; but this lenity ≈øhattered much their work; for although in the re-in≈øtating the≈øe Members, the Army pa≈ø≈øing through the heart of <hi>London,</hi> ≈øhewed them≈øelves brethren, not enemies; no force, no di≈ødain appearing; yet <hi>London</hi> was full of hot humours; and no ≈øooner was the body of the Army to that end politickly di≈øper≈øed, by the Members kept in, by every Voting, but they break forth anew.</p>
                  <p>Yea, ≈øo was the plot laid, that each County in <hi>England</hi> ≈øhould have their embroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the <hi>Scot</hi> ≈øhould return to beat down the Levelling Army, and re-inthrone the Presbyter; but declared to make way for a free Treaty with the King at the I≈øle of <hi>Wight;</hi> a ≈øure plot; for the Army every where di≈øtracted, what could they do? But the plot works, let us ≈øee the event; <hi>Wales</hi> begins, the remote part We≈øt; thither is <hi>Cromwel</hi> ≈øent; He gone, all on the ≈øudden the world is full, but happily by degrees, not as intended, but occa≈øionally; each party of Rogues, who began the work, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them≈øelves able to re-in≈øtate King <hi>Charls;</hi> the next place was <hi>Norwich,</hi> where the Lord ≈øhewed him≈øelf wonderfully, both in the height of power, and depth of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, of which only one word.</p>
                  <p>There was about two thou≈øand per≈øons in ≈øix hours time gathered together, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended untill <hi>May</hi> day, the choyce day of the Major by promi≈øcuous popular Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (I need ≈øay no more to ≈øhew the evil in ca≈øe of a future ≈øettlement) but the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor being upon mi≈øcarriage ≈øent for by a Me≈ø≈øenger of Parliament; to kill the Me≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and re≈øcue the Major, this multitude pretended to ri≈øe; but up, they broke open
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105181:42"/> one of the Sheriffs hou≈øes, and rifled the ≈øame, and the Exci≈øe Office, and then ≈øeized the Magazine of the County, in which was ninety eight barrels of powder; there were in the hou≈øe, dwellers to the number of twenty and odd of men, women, and children; the hou≈øe was large and ≈øtrong, yet they forced it open, there being Arms al≈øo for two thou≈øand per≈øons; which found out, they pre≈øently arm and charge; but the ≈øcowrers and worms being in, and they in ha≈øte, their Guns became u≈øele≈øs again≈øt the Hor≈øe, who came in to the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the Roundheads, as they were called, of whom it was re≈øolved, not one ≈øhould be left alive by the next day after. And now both Presbyter and Independent being in the ≈øame danger, they both met as friends, and accounted the ones ≈øafety the others pre≈øervation; and as God pre≈øerved the Souldier without, ≈øo did he al≈øo them within the hou≈øe; for the hou≈øe being blown up, as is mo≈øt likely by wilfulne≈øs of ≈øome of them (for it was declared the day before, it would be blown up) and above one hundred of them found dead, not one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants were ≈ølain, though under the ≈øame ruines; yea, a woman great with childe, formerly ≈øubject to mi≈øcarry, now near her time, though lying long under a great wall, was taken out ≈øafe, mi≈øcarried not, but liveth ≈øtill to prai≈øe the Lord, with tho≈øe her brethren and ≈øi≈øters, who ≈øaw them≈øelves in the grave, and were yet rai≈øed; and this was done, <hi>April</hi> the twenty fourth, One thou≈øand ≈øix hundred forty eight.</p>
                  <p>From hence were the Souldiers, while the City was yet ≈øcarce ≈øetled, called to <hi>Bury</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> thence into <hi>Kent,</hi> thence to <hi>Colche≈øter;</hi> a ≈ømall party brought <hi>Holland's</hi> and <hi>Buckingham's</hi> partakers to their ≈øhame; and the <hi>Scot,</hi> before not known whether Royal or Presbyterial, being (with much ado) di≈øowned by the Parliament, by rea≈øon, as was declared, of the in≈øufferable cruelties and rapines by them exerci≈øed upon the <hi>Engli≈øh;</hi> but the vi≈øible intere≈øt of them was wholly Royal, commixing Councels and Intere≈øt with the renegate <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> ≈øo called; and although all the breakings forth were meerly by the loo≈øe multitude, and no appearance but for the Royal party; yet this hint was taken, ≈øtrongly to urge a clo≈øe with his Maje≈øty; and to make this the le≈øs doubtfull, the Navy in great part revolt, and the ≈øtrong ≈øupporters of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian party engage in it.</p>
                  <p>Now whether the Independents were not true to the King in their Colloque, I here quaere not, nor can more then before; This I am ≈øure, they were true to them≈øelves.</p>
                  <p>But the Presbyterian party ≈øo called, were not true to them≈øelves; for the King out-went them as far as the other did him; not that I beleeve that they intended it, but that their Leaders now ≈øeeing things at a dead lift, re≈øolved to make the be≈øt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain they could for them≈øelves, not ≈øeeking the Kings Intere≈øt neither, but as it ≈øtood with their own; therefore they re≈øolve to plea≈øe the King in all; and that the Treaty might be free, ≈øend him down new Suits &amp;c. and free him from the clo≈øe impri≈øonment or re≈øtraint wherein he had ≈øuffered; and this proceeded to a large Treaty, wherein the King and his Creatures treated all matters as them li≈øted; and that which was never heard on in the world, a Prince alone to maintain Arguments both divine and civil again≈øt the utmo≈øt wits of Lawyers and Divines, and as they were printed, ≈øeemed to ≈øurmount them; yet to get him≈øelf into the Throne, and make his enemies bowe, he parted with what he had argued him≈øelf into; ≈øo they had what they had, not of right, but grant ≈øtill; and all this done with ≈øuch ≈øobriety, ≈øuch oppo≈øition, granting now a little, then a little, that a meer hone≈øt eye-witne≈øs would have been deceived, notwith≈øtanding he knew his Maje≈øty had declared him≈øelf a pri≈øoner, not free, his Son the Prince now acting by his command, avowing the Treaty forced, and the Armies of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> engaged to break all off.</p>
                  <p>But God, notwith≈øtanding all this, that breaks all the bows that were ≈øtrained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him, ≈øcatters all the≈øe clouds; only <hi>Colche≈øter,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, and the Fleet are continued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Ireland</hi> all this while was to the Parliament almo≈øt, as it hath been with me, a thing not regarded; but now there are thoughts of that, and the Army ≈øetled under a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number, with a ≈øettlement of pay re≈øpectively, and order taken for the ≈øettling the Navy, and Generals ≈øent forth; there is great thoughts of the nece≈ø≈øity of doing Ju≈øtice; mens minds had run no higher generally, then happily to bring a Lord or two to the block; but lo, God rai≈øeth mens ≈øpirits to that height, and brings them to it by degrees, that they bring even the King him≈øelf to the Barr of Ju≈øtice; O that every heart may tremble at the work of the Lord! he hath here manife≈øted his power, let all Princes tremble; <hi>Charls</hi> of <hi>England</hi> the be≈øt of Kings, I may admit, but the wor≈øt of all other men (for none hath ≈øuch obligations) is the example.</p>

                  <p>Now O all you Magi≈øtrates, ≈øee, God hath plucked him out, who was prayed for as the light of your life, and the breath of your no≈øthrils, the fountain of your ≈øo called Honours, your Idoll; and hath broken off, not only the palms of his hands and his feet, but by the Sword of the Lord hath cut off his head, as an offender again≈øt the Laws, which he was entru≈øted to be the chief Keeper of.

                  <p>How warrantable all proceedings were, I cannot at large here di≈øcu≈øs; but this is evident, as ≈øouldiers they could not ≈øo di≈øpute the matter, but their way was unju≈øt; what ever their cau≈øe was as Subjects, they could but Petition, untill a lawful power or ju≈øt nece≈ø≈øity headed them: This awhile ob≈øtructed the relief of <hi>Ireland,</hi> together with ≈øome ≈øcattered ≈øcrupling objections; as that the Land was theirs Originally, ours by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øt onely, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Arguments admitted, would reduce us all to the mountain of <hi>Arrarat,</hi> and make all Nations fight there (if they could finde them) till they had the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion which onely they could prove was the fir≈øt indubitable rightful po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of their fir≈øt Ance≈øtor after the flood; not that I think it lawful for one Nation to di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs another at lu≈øt; but po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion anciently acquired is ju≈øt, till lawfully evicted; and if the conte≈øt be drawn to the Swords deci≈øion, it is at lea≈øt lawful on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors part.</p>

                  <p>There are ju≈øt things held out under the name of Levelling, which he would hide, and his in≈øtuments; therefore I be≈øeech all holding forth a profe≈øsion of Chri≈øtianity, to walk worthy of their high Calling to which they are called in the Lord Je≈øus; not to expound, take, or receive things, matters or per≈øons into obloquie or honor for mens ≈øake, or becau≈øe of Intere≈øt ≈øake, but according to the rule of our holy profe≈øsion.</p>
                  <p>Levelling then may be con≈øidered, fir≈øt, improperly, and ≈øo inju≈øtly, that is, for a forcible taking away the property of rich men, or men that have any property be it more or le≈øs: Now this is divers, as fir≈øt, under colour of a Title, I take away the e≈øtate, whether reall or per≈øonal, of my neighbour, and will by no means come to, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther re≈øtore, or arbitrate the bu≈øine≈øs; but knowing the Law (as now u≈øed) will afford a debate la≈øting, and a trick may overthrow (as afore≈øaid) my neighbours ju≈øt right; and if he be but poor or patient, he will be quickly di≈øheartened, and I ≈øhall gain my end, and injoy as ju≈øtly, even by colour of Law, what was with dete≈øtable injury forced from another (this was the great beam in ≈øome mens eyes) and called legal Levelling, the mo≈øt unju≈øt of all, if truth it be ≈øo, which is much feared, being in all mens mouthes.</p>
                  <p>The next unju≈øt Levelling was a Tenet, that the poor had an intere≈øt in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth as well as the rich; and that every man ought to have his portion; and that the great rich men having hoarded up the Trea≈øure, and joyning hou≈øe to hou≈øe, and field to field, they had ≈øo much care for the private, that the publike was neglected; yea, that the immoderate heaping of e≈øtate was unlawful, and that there ought to be a proportion above which no man might ri≈øe; and to remedy the≈øe evils, they would have all e≈øtates ca≈øt into a common ≈øtock, and the land (at lea≈øt) divided equally; and ≈øurely they had a great pre≈øident in a famous Commonwealth, which twice (in a ≈øhort ≈øpace for ≈øuch a Revolution) or I am deceived, did ≈øuch an Act; but the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth was Heathen, and I know no Rule for us to walk by their example, unle≈øs the Word of God allow it.</p>
                  <p>The next unju≈øt Levelling, is, by forcing not an equality of divi≈øion, but a perpetual community, as ≈øuppo≈øing all evils to grow principally from the infatiable thir≈øt after riches; therefore the≈øe propound, Not now to apportion e≈øtates, and after to ≈øettle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and admit buying &amp; ≈øelling, and tran≈ømutations of po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, and ≈øo an alteration of the fir≈øt ≈øettlement by degrees; but to ve≈øt the whole intere≈øt in the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to ≈øettle allowances; fir≈øt, for exceeding vertue, as Magi≈øtrates, and all for eminent excellencies imployed in publike tru≈øt, according to their ≈øet and unalterably appointed degrees; and next for the multitude, according to a like ≈øet and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proportion, except by the publike Magi≈øtrate appointed, re≈øpect being duly had unto the number, and condition, of Age or Youth, and other qualifications, according to the plot laid down in that exqui≈øite piece of Sir <hi>Tho. Moore,</hi> intending, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of a Commonwealth, according to the rule of Nature, perfected by Evangelical Doctrine; and ≈øure it is, were ≈øuch a State from a voluntary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned de≈øire of well and righteous living, voluntarily e≈øtabli≈øhed, it were an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paradi≈øe; and that it is not impo≈ø≈øible, the pattern of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> State over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming the mo≈øt difficult parts of it, plainly declares; But its thought fit, not the powers onely, but the body are to be convinced of ≈øuch things moderately and wi≈øely, not by indi≈øcreet agitations, much le≈øs perturbations of a State, they are to be left to their judgements, God will effect a≈ø≈øuredly ≈øuch things as he hath determined in his appointed ≈øea≈øon.</p>
                  <p>Another Levelling here called unju≈øt, that is, from error continued, or by force at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, as was objected, (≈øome ≈øo pretending, being in≈øtrumental in renewing wars, and to cau≈øe out breakings) is in them, who were thought happily to ≈øettle or attempt the ≈øettlement of their own private frame of Commonwealth, by ≈øuch means; but truly, though ≈øome a≈ø≈øi≈øt, and others more wi≈øe declare them≈øelves not willing to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105181:44"/> oppo≈øe, yet I hope, yea, and am verily per≈øwaded of ≈øome of them, they did both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpectively, out of a tenderne≈øs to men whom they had known valiantly to oppo≈øe the common pretended Enemy, out of con≈øcience of the intere≈øt they now ≈øeemingly oppo≈øed, or at lea≈øt cleaved not unto, though they avowed they adhered to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt always pretended, but the men were changed, and acted not as they had declared.</p>
                  <p>Others were opinionated, that community was the Regiment of the Lord Je≈øus; and that all Chri≈øtians ought to ≈øubmit to it; and they may ≈øay true, but that time may not be yet; and when it is, ≈øurely it will not be a confu≈øed community; the community among the Apo≈øtles (≈øtretched only to voluntary ≈øales, and that) was, ≈øomewhat for the pre≈øent nece≈ø≈øity, but e≈øpecially and for ever to manife≈øt they were all as one Family, under their Head the Lord Je≈øus; and that no man called a Chri≈øtian, could call ought his own, while his faithful brother ≈øtood in need, which was, though not inforced, ever held by all Chri≈øtians, how ever weakly practi≈øed, and in the declining State of the Church, grew more obnoxious, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>o evident neglect.</p>
                  <p>Now ≈øuch a community, that the poor Chri≈øtian being laborious (if able to work) ≈øhould be relieved where his labour failed, or in what it reached not unto (that ≈øo he might live comfortably, and rejoyce in the Covenant of his God) a≈ø≈øuredly ought, and I hope will be reduced to its original purity.</p>
                  <p>Now there was another unju≈øt Levelling talked of; which was an unregulated com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, that is, the ≈øetitng up the Law of Naturals without the Divine regulations; that is, to live like bea≈øts, to kill and eat, to live each man to his lu≈øts, and the ≈øtronger to overcome the weaker; which confu≈øion having u≈øhered in a nece≈ø≈øity of regulation, then and thereby to lay the foundations from that nece≈øsity, of a holy or ju≈øt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity among the people; ≈øuppo≈øing men, while enjoying ought a≈ø≈øuredly, would not be drawn to an unintere≈øted Politie, wherein, though the end be approved, yet no ju≈øt man will allow the means, if he remember we mu≈øt not do evil that good may come of it, no not in this juncture of time when the flood-gates of Liberty were broken up, though that ≈øome may think, to that end Providence ≈øo ordered the matter; and to men ≈øo ≈øettled, there is no chain ≈øtrong enough.</p>
                  <p>O Lord, I pray thee open ≈øuch eyes, e≈øpecially of tho≈øe that from a ≈øincere heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire thy glory, lea≈øt their zeal, not according to knowledge, make thy truth and zeal for thee evil ≈øpoken of; and mo≈øt like it is, of ≈øuch ≈øpirits were they, who were ≈øeduced, if ≈øeduced, or that they drew away them≈øelves and others with them.</p>
                  <p>But let them know, that in ≈øuch unruly breakings out of parties into contentions of divided intere≈øts, it is more lawful for their oppo≈øites, being in pre≈øent power, to ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and puni≈øh them, then for them to labour and indeavour by force or di≈øobedience to ≈øubdue or ca≈øhiere their oppo≈øites: And now I am come to the more particular di≈øcu≈ø≈øion of ju≈øt Levelling (or ju≈øt things held out by men, no way aiming at any by, or corrupt end, or intere≈øt whatever.)</p>
                  <p>Ju≈øt Levelling then ≈øo called is an impropriety in regard of the acceptance of the word, a propriety in regard of the end; for it looks at ju≈øt things ju≈øtly, however it is ≈øcandalized; and is in a word, but the rule of proportionate Ju≈øtice: I ≈øay, not onely Ju≈øtice, but proportionate, that is, that there be not onely one Law, but that Law held forth with due re≈øpects of equity and righteou≈øne≈øs; as for example, To charge a Gentleman that hath three hundred pound a year, a hor≈øe for Service, and to charge him for 300. <hi>li.</hi> a year, to a Rate is ju≈øt, for ≈øuch an e≈øtate there is; and to charge a Gentleman of three thou≈øand pound a year, a hor≈øe al≈øo, is ju≈øt; and to charge him for three thou≈øand pound <hi>per annum</hi> is ju≈øt; but this is not levelled, that is, brought to the proportion of equal di≈øtributive Ju≈øtice; for if you will do ≈øo, then the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mu≈øt, and ought to be thus fixed; (fir≈øt, admitting that qualifications of the mind, though honored, be not charged; for that of the Poll-money was in that exceedingly unju≈øt; divers Knights, E≈øquires, Doctors, Attornyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not being worth the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney they were a≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed at by the Poll) but I ≈øay that excepted, they mu≈øt fix a Rule for the value of a Gentleman, E≈øquire, Knight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which end, Suppo≈øe the e≈øtate of a Gentleman be 300. <hi>li. per annum,</hi> as before, and that this ≈øhal be charged one hor≈øe: then a Gentleman of 600. <hi>l.</hi> mu≈øt be three; for if that three hundred maintain a Gentleman and one hor≈øe, ≈øix hundred may maintain two hor≈øes more; and ≈øo in proportion in all charges and duties in the Commonwealth.</p>

                  <p>The≈øe Levellers prefer the integrity of a Religious conver≈øation in all things an≈øwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ≈øtrictne≈øs of their holy profe≈ø≈øion, above all policy and carnal intere≈øts; therefore they honour rich men, but they e≈øpecially e≈øteem and tru≈øt vertuous men; and therefore de≈øire, that in publike Admini≈øtrations the ba≈øis and ≈øettlement of the Commonwealth may be ≈øo tempered, that the vertuous, and experienced judicious man may not be ca≈øhiered a fit Regiment for want of Riches, being well knowing that the purity and corruption of intere≈øt are the props and decayes of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth re≈øpectively as they are admitted.</p>
                  <p>They deny not that the foundations of <hi>England</hi> ≈øettlement were ju≈øt, nor that there was alwayes a politick ≈øettlement held forth; but they ≈øay it was never practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed as held forth, and yet held forth far ≈øhort of what the perfection of our profe≈ø≈øion enlightens unto; whereupon they urge, that the whole frame of our Government, Civil as well as Eccle≈øia≈øtick, ought to be brought to the Standard of Ju≈øtice, at lea≈øt to that the Declarations of Parliament ≈øeem to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>They al≈øo de≈øired, if the State took Tonnage, and Poundage, Cu≈øtomes, &amp;c. that the Seas might be guarded (and ≈øome ≈øaid, if they did not, it was lawful to ≈øteal Cu≈øtome, but I put that opinion in a Parenthe≈øis) they de≈øired that no per≈øon or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of men might be ≈øecured from Law; that all evils as appearing, might be at ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, rectified; and to that end, that an ea≈øie addre≈øs might be to Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice, ≈øetled in power in the re≈øpective bounds, both for ending and determining ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law ≈øetled, and preparing for remedy to emergent evils by certificate of the matter.</p>

                  <p>The≈øe men further allowed and de≈øired, that per≈øons ≈øhould be brought into due degrees, the due power of all per≈øons re≈øpectively ≈øetled, the primitive order for ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Nation by the enforcing the Laws of Tythings for idle vagrant per≈øons, Hues and Cryes for Thefts, Robberies, and ≈øuch like, that due orders of Cities, and Walled Towns, Bridges, and great Roads for Watches, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>The rea≈øon why I call the≈øe ju≈øt things Levelling, is to unmask the≈øe Satans, and to manife≈øt to all men the ≈øtrange artifices u≈øed to ob≈øtruct the truth, and take men off from the entertaning true apprehen≈øions of it, ≈øugge≈øting to them the≈øe jealou≈øies; that though the Propo≈øitions held forth nothing but ≈øeemingly ju≈øt, hone≈øt, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian, yet no doubt there was a Snake lay in the gra≈øs, to eat in pieces the root of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and deba≈øe the Supremacy of Magi≈øtracy, de≈øtroy order, annihilate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and introduce the confu≈øion (which ≈øome, as I have ≈øaid, are ≈øaid to intend) and we may ju≈øtly fear, if ≈øome timely and ju≈øt order preventive be not applyed, will by the≈øe ≈øelf-≈øeekers be a≈ø≈øuredly perfected.</p>
                  <p>But all the≈øe ju≈øt Levellers had not the ≈øame foundation or principle for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigns; though know a≈ø≈øuredly, all hone≈øt men reall and of publike ≈øpirits, Papi≈øt or Kings Prote≈øtant (that is, he that would walk no further in the way of Chri≈øt then the Laws of the Land taught him; that is, beleeving as was by Law e≈øtabli≈øhed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Canon, &amp;c. yet zealou≈øly making con≈øcience of being wi≈øer then his Teachers) Presbyter or Independent, or of any Sect, Opinion, or Religion ≈øoever, were nick-named Levellers, by them that found it be≈øt fi≈øhing in troubled pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led waters.</p>
                  <p>But as I ≈øay, they had ≈øeveral principles; The Presbyter founding his Levelling upon the Judicials of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> ≈øtuck to that Rule, that the Judicials were Gods own Law given to his own people, with whom he had entered a Covenant, not only upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> but in the loyns of <hi>Abraham,</hi> father of the faithful, that ≈øo <hi>Abraham</hi> is our father, and we by faith his ≈øeed, and ≈øo bound.</p>
                  <p>Again, that the people cho≈øen of God, were Types of all Gods people, to whom that Law was given in them, and living according to that Law, ≈øhould thereby mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105181:46"/> them≈øelves each to other to be the people of God, that Chri≈øt had not de≈øtroyed this Law, he came to fulfill it: And la≈øtly, they enforced this from the rule of rea≈øon; If man had no boundary to his Rea≈øon, no rule to make his Law by, rea≈øon would be infinite, which error had been the foundation of ≈øo many dreadful alterations as States had ≈øuffered under, in ≈øuch clymaterick revolutions as now this Nation laboured under; and therefore they de≈øired the drawing of <hi>Englands</hi> Laws to their primitive rule, namely the Judicials. This was objected again≈øt by others, who yet de≈øired a rule of righteou≈øne≈øs, alledging, that if this were the Rule, then it mu≈øt be all ≈øo, or but part; not all, for the Ceremonial Law being the ≈øhadow, fled away at the coming of Chri≈øt in the body; and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had done evil, yea, that it was the foundation and root of their ≈øo dangerous Apo≈øtacy, to carry the ≈øhadow along with the body; for, from thence had come their high power of the Pope, their ≈øacring of Churches, as well as per≈øons, their Altars, Trinckets, &amp;c. their Jubiles, Pardons, Indulgences, &amp;c. Canonical hours, holy Ve≈øtments, and all the re≈øt of their tra≈øh; and that one admitted, all would follow; and as the entertaining the amu≈øive or formal part of wor≈øhip into religious ≈øervices, had under the ≈øupremacy of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øia≈øtick power defiled Church and Commonwealth, taking away all ≈øence of inward, ≈øerious, con≈øcionable, moral duty, as well as religious, and re≈øting only in the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior form, either the pomp of the action, or the act it ≈øelf: So now, in the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eccle≈øia≈øtick power, by the Magi≈øterial Civil power, the Commonwealth would at la≈øt lay the foundation of a new defilement to the Church; and that this might be, was too too evident by the precedent example: So that we ≈øhould but change the Tables, and keep the fal≈øe Dice ≈øtill, which would never better our game; and therefore they ≈øaid, that unle≈øs there could be ≈øhewed exactly which part of the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials, by an infallible word, and that as given by <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> (that is, not as confirmed by Chri≈øt or his Apo≈øtles) was the rule of Chri≈øtian duty, they would take none at all (as ≈øo given) for if man were Judge of a part of that Law, how agreeable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof he or they were rulers, then of all; and if ≈øo, then as good take pure rea≈øon, not contrary to the Law of Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles, but founded rather upon his Doctrine, in the general rule, though the particular application might vary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect of circum≈øtances, ≈øo not rejecting the judicials, but not taking them as obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, as given to the Jew, the people of God, or typing out all Chri≈øtian Nations, or an En≈øign of the faith, but as a wi≈øe Law, yea the wi≈øe≈øt, as being the dictates of the prime wi≈ødom, the ≈øame God that the Chri≈øtians wor≈øhipped, they not only admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but de≈øired ≈øuch as were con≈øonant to Chri≈øtian rea≈øon to be e≈øtabli≈øhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt us.</p>
                  <p>There were ≈øome particular contentions, as fir≈øt for Tythes, ≈øecondly Appeals, next the Sabboth, then Theft not to be death, then Adultery and Bla≈øphemy to be death; and the≈øe were things of principal Intere≈øt indeed: But the Intere≈øt (in part, which di≈øcredited the whole) was ≈øo vi≈øible, as I cannot allow it, though I may them who ≈øought the thing as afflicted in ≈øpirit, ≈øeeing the want of con≈øcience in multitudes, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill of all called Mini≈øters, for ≈øome evil mens ≈øakes, open prophanation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both by tho≈øe profe≈ø≈øed a Sabboth (and by the la≈øt Act re≈øtrained in part, and left in other part as loo≈øe as before) petty Theft, death; yet in the ≈øame State common and manife≈øt Adultery go without any puni≈øhment or que≈øtion (&amp; all for want of a rule, for we hear of long debates about it) and Swearing and Bla≈øphemy almo≈øt as ordinary as ≈øpeaking; yet proof made difficult, and puni≈øhment ea≈øie, but no con≈øcience of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming; for few thought it a ≈øin; for the great men and the wi≈øe men were mo≈øt guilty and gloried in it; ≈øo that it was evident, that as ≈øome ≈øought the re-e≈øtabli≈øhment of the old frame of Government, and that both in Church ≈øo called and State, according to the old pattern of the Erroneous Church, or Apo≈øtacy of <hi>Rome,</hi> founding upon the equity and u≈øeful allu≈øion (≈øo called) of the <hi>Mo≈øaical Judicials</hi> and <hi>Ceremonials;</hi> ≈øome nothing but confu≈øion: ≈øo others de≈øired one wholly new, avoiding all the errors which corrupt intere≈øts had introduced; and that not only becau≈øe the way of Error was before tracked, and therefore ea≈øie to be trodden anew, but as being builded upon a fal≈øe foundation, as well as by time and error corrupted and perverted.</p>
                  <p>Some of the≈øe, though holding the truth, were by a part of them≈øelvs ≈øuppo≈øed to be in an error, while pre≈øuming upon the wonderful mercies the Lord had be≈øtowed upon them, they were over-ra≈øh in their de≈øires of a change; for the evident ≈øymptomes of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:105181:46"/> unavoidable ruine, ≈øay they, threaten us, the multitude of intere≈øts are ≈øo divers, and contrary; how few are there to manage ≈øuch a work? not one to ten, if one to an hundred: this were to tempt God, To expect miracles in a day when miracles cea≈øe; God bade the <hi>Jew</hi> not de≈øtroy all their enemies at once, le≈øt the bea≈øts ≈øhould prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt them; it may hold forth the ≈øimplicity of the Dove, but not the ≈øubtilty of the Serpent, which is requi≈øite in this ca≈øe; for you ≈øee, ≈øay they, what a conte≈øt hath been with the ≈øingle intere≈øt of the Clergy, and the ≈øcattered fry of their corrupt Courts; but if you engage again≈øt all the remainders of them, with the numerous off-≈øpring of all Courts, as of Judges, Serjeants, Coun≈øellors, Sollicitors, Attorneys, Protho-notaries, Secondaries, Clerks of the Crown, Clerks of A≈øsi≈øe, Clerks of the Exigents, Clerks of the Papers, Clerks of the Warrants, Clerks of the E≈ø≈øoyne, Clerks of the Juries, Clearks of the Pipe, Clerke of the Kings ≈øilver, Clerks of the Seal, Clerk of the Peace, <hi>Cu≈øtos brevium,</hi> Chyrographers, Fillizer, Mar≈øhals, Cryers, Waiters, Chancellors, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers, Six Clerks, Regi≈øters, Comptrollers of the Seal, Examiners, Clerk of the Hamper, Clerk of the petty Bag, Cur≈øiters, Serjeants of the Mace, U≈øhers of the Court, Clerks in nature of ordinary Attorneys, with many more, and all the≈øe having their adherents; for which of the≈øe but come in under ≈øome corrupt intere≈øt or other?</p>
                  <p>But generally, the chief in Offices, at lea≈øt of profit, as Judges, Serjeants, Councellors, Advocates, Doctors, Proctors, Attorneys, Six Clerks, Clerks of A≈ø≈øize, &amp;c. are all the younger Brethren, or ≈øons of Lords, or of their Families, however of the greate≈øt Gent. and of the Parliament men them≈øelves, and ≈øetled by the Ba≈øtard ≈øo called the Conquerour upon a politick Maxime,</p>
                  <p>That the Land in <hi>England</hi> being appointed for the ≈øafeguard of the Kingdom, might not be brackled away; therefore as all the Land went to the elde≈øt, the≈øe were the wayes of educating and maintaining the younger, make them Lawyers, and make the Laws dubious, Offices plentiful, and there would be (as experience hath proved it ≈øufficiently) a plentiful portion; then ≈øettle Tythes, encrea≈øe Gleabs, build Mona≈øteries, &amp;c. and there is another portion, Colledges and Halls I will reckon to them, then Phy≈øicians and Merchants; ≈øo that if you ≈øeek due Reformation, you will make each one your enemie, and the whole world will be again≈øt you; and nothing but confu≈øion can be u≈øhered in by the pretended Reformation; you will have Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, City, Countrey, Lords, Gentry, Comminalty, and all again≈øt you; nay, if you will purge throughly, you mu≈øt alter the whole cour≈øe of all commerce.</p>
                  <p>For there is no Traffique according to a rule of Righteou≈øne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>Let Errors as they came by degrees, ≈øo by degrees be reduced, pull out a crazie ≈øtone, but put in a good one; the contrary party objected, that this was to dawb with untempered Morter, not to ≈øerve God but them≈øelves, that it was to pretend to do good, and do evil; that this was the Error of the King and the two fir≈øt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that they had upheld following providence, to mount into the Carr of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; that they had dared enough then again≈øt all intere≈øts, Kingly, Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, Countrey and City; by their executing <hi>Charls,</hi> and impri≈øoning the members, Garri≈øoning the City, &amp; Quartering in the Counties: Thus were matters bandied, and ≈øome parties grew ≈øo fierce (as anger is alwayes a ≈øhort madne≈øs) that they did they knew not what; which yet te≈øtified that their anger was ≈øelfi≈øh; others more wi≈øely wrote, but unwi≈øely in that they remembred not they ≈øtirred a Lyon; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended ≈øo much upon their fir≈øt engagement to the Parliament, that they thought they might have ≈øaid any thing.</p>
                  <p>Let truth bear ≈øway, ≈øhe alwayes carrieth a Maje≈øty and will prevail; but many tell truth, ≈øome with upbraidings and revilings, ≈øome with cur≈øings, and others (almo≈øt all) with bitterne≈øs; truth is a≈øhamed by the≈øe frailties, and ≈øuffers for a weak ≈øervants ≈øake.</p>
                  <p>But the≈øe men concealed their names; and though ≈øome wi≈øe men did ≈øo, yet their writings were ≈øuch as could not ju≈øtly be traduced for ≈øcandall or ≈øedition; and the≈øe men neither owned their names when their books were mo≈øt acceptable; nor in times mo≈øt dark and dangerous; but ≈øome of the≈øe others owned them ≈øometimes, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while they denyed them, whereby they were ≈øu≈øpected of no great integrity; others did openly own their works in times of great danger under the King, and al≈øo under the Parliament, yea even when they oppo≈øed them in their highe≈øt priviledges, ≈øome debating one thing, ≈øome another, yea ≈øome again≈øt the publike tran≈øactions of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105181:47"/> State, and ≈øome for a general liberty of all opinions, and printing and publi≈øhing (which to be ≈øetled with ≈øafety to the State, and no prejudice to the light of truth, is a matter difficult, but of importance, not to be neglected) they al≈øo urged to the men in power the hand of God upon the Nation, how introduced, that the ≈øame or wor≈øe evils were now upon us, our Courts of all ≈øorts having changed rather their Judges then their ju≈øtice, that Committees were wor≈øe rather then ordinary Courts, as being made of tho≈øe per≈øons who were the ≈øupream Judges; and they erring, all the inferiour wheels might well move out of order.</p>
                  <p>And proceedings in Parliament were the ≈øame, ≈øo difficult, dilatory, and ≈øo expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive, that men were even tired in body as in ≈øpirit; they did acknowledge the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and difficulty of the work, they con≈øidered intere≈øts, and yet they thought there was not that expedition or integrity requi≈øite to ≈øo high tru≈øts in ≈øuch a ≈øea≈øon of judgement.</p>
                  <p>And this was evidenced by the expedition in matters of intere≈øt private (≈øo called) that is to the a≈ø≈øurance of the acquired Supremacy, and rai≈øing the due a≈ø≈øe≈øsments, but not in the general ≈øettlement as was propounded; this draws ≈øome men to that piece ≈øo called the Agreement of the people; a thing, which were the people capable of ≈øuch a work, might, if rightly ≈øtated, be of great availe; but indeed to put into the hands of ≈øo va≈øt a multitude, of ≈øuch divers intere≈øts, and that without an a≈ø≈øured and competent number to carry on the work, which in probability they neither had, nor could have had, without imploying the Sword-men (which in it ≈øelf had totally ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined the nature of an Agreement) had unravelled all the work, and ≈øet us as far back as at the beginning; but that the propounders of it were turned recreant to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples (≈øome particular man might) or had joyned intere≈øt with the Royall party, I cannot beleeve it.</p>
                  <p>But I ≈øuppo≈øe really they were by that party and ≈øome others of eager ≈øpirits it may be, really longing and breathing after Righteou≈øne≈øs, and ≈øetling the Kingdom of Je≈øus Chri≈øt (I fear yet in their own ≈øtrength) encouraged to go on in their de≈øign, (which ≈øome of them politickly ≈øaw tended to divide, and that was to let them raign) but ≈øurely the≈øe Royal in≈øtigators were men of lo≈øt condition: for what could the i≈ø≈øue have been, but renewing a more deadly and confu≈øed warr? for the multitude being by this Act publikely appealed to, and that by the ≈øole exi≈øtent power Civill, they mu≈øt have a≈ø≈øumed the ab≈øolute ≈øupremacy into the meer vulgar Ocean; and ≈øoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er can you ≈øet bounds to the Ocean then their appetites: This fore≈øeen, this piece was after long debate, with much wi≈ødom, for the pre≈øent, ca≈øt into the number of Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Remon≈øtrances, &amp;c. of Parliament, to be by their mature advi≈øements qualified, fit for propagating common intere≈øt in due time; but this ob≈øtruction imbittered the more, and made ≈øome ≈øpirits, under concealed, or not owned names, to ≈øet abroach the failings, errors, and mi≈øcarriages of all the Members in Parliament, or el≈øe ≈øcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize them; and pinching ≈øtill the able≈øt and active≈øt, they hoped to foyl ≈øo, that ≈øome ≈øoyle ≈øhould remain, though mo≈øt would not gain credit.</p>
                  <p>Far be it from me, pretending integrity, to a≈ø≈øert what I know not, but I mu≈øt hope the Charges again≈øt ≈øome men, if not the mo≈øt, are meerly ≈øugge≈øtions of envy to eminent vertue; for I ≈øee great things done by them, and their words are ≈øweet as honey: Truth is, I am not ≈øo blind neither, but I can ≈øee and hear that favour and friend≈øhip is the Mi≈øtre≈øs with the State, as it was at Court; and oppre≈ø≈øion and covetize is not ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed <hi>Englands</hi> Commonweale; but I mu≈øt ≈øay, that retorted, is as true, namely, that it is incident to men neglected to complain, and ≈øo to men oppre≈ø≈øed; I would allow an equall and ≈øpeedy tryall according to my rule, even to my deadlie≈øt (manly) enemy; the want of this hath much exa≈øperated many, and gained none cordially.</p>
                  <p>Now in all this enarration, you ≈øay, what coherence is there 'twixt Chri≈øt and his Doctrine; his profe≈ø≈øors, and their conver≈øation? had we not better have ≈øate ≈øtill? How many thou≈øands, nay ten thou≈øands hath this Warr co≈øt, as in the Kingdomes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is evident? But I cannot agree the Doctrine, it was nece≈ø≈øary to purge, it is evident there was need and great need of Reformation; let not the particular errors of Reformers cau≈øe us to fall out with duty; But while they fail, let us as we ≈øhould, ≈øeek the Lord with double diligence. I know there is much objected, but the matters mo≈øt eyed, are fir≈øt of pur≈øe-concernment, as the Taxes or A≈ø≈øe≈øsments for the Army,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105181:47"/> the Exci≈øe, Cu≈øtoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein many that are contented to pay, do yet much repine at the inequality of the levy.</p>
                  <p>But as to them I mu≈øt ≈øay, I know they in Supream tru≈øt have of late done much, nay, almo≈øt as much as in them lies; its perticular intere≈øt now ob≈øtructs; the real truth is, corrupt principles have ≈øuch root in us, that gain is above all godline≈øs; men eminent could be willing all others ≈øhould have Ju≈øtice, ≈øo they might be favored.</p>
                  <p>Yet this one thing might well be yet provided for in the Act, that per≈øons of not above four pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> and not able to work; or having a charge of children, and no per≈øonal e≈øtate, to the value of ten pounds, and not being Farmers, but living upon that, ≈øhould not be charged; many now paying twenty ≈øhillings <hi>per annum</hi> to the war, who are fitter to receive collection; and many worth four or five thou≈øands, nay ten thou≈øand pounds per≈øonal e≈øtate, not taxed at all; or if at all, not above one ≈øhilling or one ≈øhilling ≈øix pence for three months.</p>
                  <p>The next matter chiefly eyed was (after the alteration of the State from a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy to a Free State or Republike) to con≈øider what ≈øhould now be done to make good that freedom promi≈øed; and the fir≈øt, or one of the fir≈øt matters exi≈øtent as a Law, was the Act for Trea≈øons; the Objections again≈øt the ≈øub≈øtance of the Act as to the matters what is Trea≈øon, I for the pre≈øent omit to relate, but pa≈øs to the forfeiture, which is to the State as to the King; and this ≈øome humbly conceive not agreeable to the rule of ju≈øt Freedom; hear their rea≈øons ≈øhortly.</p>
                  <p>They ≈øay fir≈øt, That it is unju≈øt to puni≈øh the childe for the fathers offence; that it is evident that this was not the original Law of <hi>England,</hi> Nature, or Nations, but the u≈øurpation of Princes Heathen, imitated by Chri≈øtians for profit ≈øake; that it is a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to think love of the e≈øtate, or of wife, or children, will deter, where the life is not con≈øidered; and that this layes the ≈øame foundation for the State to ≈øeek by the rigour of Laws to gain e≈øtates to it ≈øelf, as in the King; ≈øo that now our condition is not bettered in our Liberties; for as our Supreames may be more merciful; ≈øo they may be more rigorous; the ≈øettled equal Law is the Subjects be≈øt priviledge.</p>
                  <p>Again, In the Act for Trea≈øon, they ≈øay, this ≈øeeking of intere≈øt is evident in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of Coynage of money, Clipping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being a work private, much evil may be done, and no legal di≈øcovery made, as late frequent practi≈øe in all places hath evidenced; but to put a penalty upon the offerer of it, would ≈øoon give a full ≈øtop to it; and that is the be≈øt Law which effects its ends with lea≈øt publike or private detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; now to forfeit the piece ≈øo clipped, filed, or rounded, would ≈øtop the currant; but to forfeit that, and ≈øo much more, would dry it up quickly, e≈øpecially if it had an ea≈øie Trial, as before the next Ju≈øtice, or two next Con≈øtables, or ≈øome certain number of the neighbourhood, and the faulty money immediatly to be cut in pieces: I ≈øpeak not of Coyning, Stamping, Counterfeiting, and Wa≈øhing; let due penalties be (by Law) impo≈øed; onely trial ≈øpeedy and ea≈øie.</p>
                  <p>The next Act controverted, is that of Printing; the Objections again≈øt which being publikely avowed in Print, though ≈øome may ≈øay more wittily then with found Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian con≈øideration, I ≈øhall here onely ≈øay thus much, that as is there in part held forth, it is likely to be found the be≈øt expedient to ≈øtop the current of calumnious Printing, not to do things ≈øubjecting to ≈øcandal; and a≈ø≈øuredly all moderate men will a≈ø≈øert the Magi≈øtrate again≈øt the Calumniator, if to this end the Pre≈øs were open, provided that each man would own his work; and like the old Greeki≈øh propounder of a new Law, write under the peril of his life; it might be an u≈øeful expedient to take off Tryflers, though it might endanger many, who≈øe zeal were either too much, or knowledge too little.</p>
                  <p>I am now come ≈øhortly to the great rubb at pre≈øent, which is the Engagement, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt which none ≈øure but preingaged per≈øons can (as matters ≈øtand) object ju≈øtly; for otherwi≈øe to re≈øolve Con≈øcience, we mu≈øt ravel the Succe≈ø≈øions of all powers; for if the actual po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Supream power, doth not inable to require all Political o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, then ≈øurely acque≈øts without ju≈øt Title are void, if ≈øo time cannot remedy it, if ≈øo it concerns all powers to ju≈øtifie to each Scrupler, not onely his pedegree, but the ju≈øtice of it from the beginning (I may ≈øay of the world) but it is plain the Boglers at the work are ≈øuch as look for an other change: It is certain, Protection requires Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and it is as certain that they are happy in Politicks, who in the Changes of Government are ≈øo di≈øpo≈øed by the Supream Wi≈ødom (for mans alone will not avail)
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105181:48" rendition="simple:additions"/> that they exerci≈øe the extream or height of Rigidity or Mercy aright (for one is ever found nece≈ø≈øary.)</p>
                  <p>And now I am come to the la≈øt great conte≈øt, the peoples Liberties: The que≈øtions are fir≈øt concerning an extraordinary Commi≈ø≈øion to try ≈øitting the odinary Courts at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the holding up the hand, opening of doors, both which were pre≈ø≈øed; I fear ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make a party, and oppo≈øe the pre≈øent Power, then out of Con≈øcience I omit them here.</p>
                  <p>The next was, Whether in Ca≈øe of Life a man may have Councel?</p>
                  <p>A third, Concerning the lawfulne≈øs of requiring, and taking the general plea, not guilty.</p>
                  <p>The la≈øt, Whether the Iury be Iudges meerly of fact or of Law al≈øo; and to the≈øe well may be added two things more, namely the Queries concerning maintenance in pri≈øon, And arre≈øting by an armed power in the time of peace.</p>
                  <p>All which indeed are of main concernment to the Nation and people; yea, even as much as Lives and Liberties, matters of the mo≈øt pretious re≈øpect with men, and ju≈øtly to be inquired into, wherein I ≈øhall only ≈øhortly give the general Opinions and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men wi≈øe and de≈øiring ju≈øt things, but withall entreating briefly of the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of our Laws pro≈øecution which hitherto hath been purpo≈øely waved.</p>
                  <p>I take it, that the Law of <hi>England,</hi> according to the rule before ≈øaid down, owns a twofold way of bringing per≈øons criminous to trial; which is, that of appeal, of which I ≈øhall onely hint what it was, being now a thing, as before I ≈øaid, wholly di≈øu≈øed, namely, it is a pro≈øecution of the party, be it for Maihem or Felony of any ≈øort, and in the name of the party appealing; which ≈øuit he might by the Law compound for, and relea≈øe, yea, if it were for murder (at lea≈øt it was ≈øo u≈øed) which liberty being much abu≈øed, the parties, who upon the heat of the blood, that is, while the injury was fre≈øh complained, were bound over by Recognizance to pro≈øecute for the King; and ≈øo were the Witne≈ø≈øes; (but if the party, or the Witne≈ø≈øes, ≈øhould refu≈øe it, it might much be ≈øcrupled, what by our Law ought to be done to inforce them ju≈øtly; but Cu≈øtome hath prevailed) to go by ≈øteps: The places of Trial of Crimes, are either the Ordinary, as Kings-Bench, or Statute-Se≈ø≈øions, or the Extraordinary, and yet Ordinary, <hi>viz.</hi> the Commi≈ø≈øions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter.</hi> and Gaol Delivery carried down alwayes with the Iu≈øtices of <hi>Ni≈øi Prius</hi> at the A≈ø≈øizes, or the legal Extraordinary, which were an a≈ø≈øotiation of more men then ordinary, according to the novelty and exigency of the cau≈øe, mo≈øt legally and u≈øually made up of all the Iudges of all the Benches, and no other, and heard in the Checkquer Chamber. Now the≈øe are not to be ≈øcrupled in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; the other, and which are extraordinary and ≈øcrupled as illegal, are meer Royal Commi≈ø≈øioners con≈øi≈øting of Iudges, Lords, and other men, according to the plea≈øure of the prime Magi≈øtrate; and the≈øe were rare, and but in ca≈øe of great offences or doubts of imminent, at le≈øt ≈øo pretended concernment.</p>
                  <p>And there were two Cau≈øes, the one profe≈ø≈øed, which was the re≈øolution of many wi≈øe men ≈øworn to do right, according to Law, betwixt the King or State, and the Subject, who by concurrent Votes a≈ø≈øured the intere≈øt of either party; and ≈øurely, were the Law by which they judged as plain and evident, as the rea≈øon or foundation of their extraordinary judgements, there would be no exception; but the fear heretofore on the peoples part which is the ground to the pre≈øent jealou≈øies, was in re≈øpect that Commi≈ø≈øions pretended of that nature, were aiding to the inchroaching vertue of the Supream Power, to the advance of Prerogative, e≈øpecially after King <hi>James</hi> had made the Iudges (which were the leaders in both the≈øe powers) his meer Creatures by ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute dependance in altering their Patents, as afore≈øaid, from during their well abearing to during his plea≈øure: How the Iudges Patents are now, I know not; but except the pre≈øent condition of affairs make that now lawful, which in it ≈øelf is not, ≈øurely ≈øuch Arbritrary Patents are introductive of the heights of va≈ø≈øalage; for if they in each Punctilio advance not the intendments and intere≈øts on foot of the Supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate, be it good or evil, for God, or again≈øt Liberty or Bondage: A Writ of Ea≈øe is next to be expected, and that engages to the ≈ølander of every malitious enemy, and he now lies open to the la≈øh of every accu≈øer; e≈øpecially if any litigious per≈øon hath been overthrown before him, O how the man bu≈øtles, and now is his time for revenge! our eys have ≈øeen this, and this I ≈øuppo≈øe to be the ground of fears of ≈øuch Commi≈ø≈øions.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:105181:48"/>
                  <p>I willingly avoid Ravelling Controver≈øies upon pre≈øidents, which in our Laws are ≈øo many, and ≈øo diver≈øe each from other, and multitudes ≈øo contrary each to other, as ≈øupream or mo≈øt excellent rea≈øon mu≈øt bear ≈øway; and then the <hi>arbitrium</hi> of the Commi≈ø≈øion will not be ≈øo much the que≈øtion, as the Law by which judged. If it be objected again≈øt the adjoyning in Royal Commi≈øsions, that they are nor Lawyers nor Iudges in Ordinary, but Merchants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ≈øay, there lies an Appeal to Parliament, from any Court, Ordinary, or Extraordinary, which receives Commi≈øsion under the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Authority.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, they are meerly the States Pentioners, then the Argument is again≈øt the Supream Magi≈øtrate mediately, again≈øt their Iudges immediately, and is remedied by appeal; but this is manife≈øt, that there is no nece≈øsity of the≈øe Commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions; they were continually declaimed again≈øt, and denied as one gap to invade the native proper liberty of the Subject, and if now inforced, can but foment jealou≈øie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the State.</p>
                  <p>Having now found out the proper Courts of Trial of criminal per≈øons; let us ≈øee who the criminous per≈øon is, and how to be dealt withal; the criminous per≈øon is vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken to be him that is accu≈øed, Legally him that is convicted, not differencing where upon examination before the Iu≈øtice there is confe≈øsion of the party, full evidence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on oath, violent pre≈øumptions, or barely ≈øu≈øpition; but all are dealt withal alike, except they mi≈ødemean them≈øelves; and in ca≈øe the matter be baylable, baylable alike, few Iu≈øtices looking at good bail, but all the Clerks at their Fees; in which ca≈øe much error is where the Clerk is Iu≈øtice of the Peace, or <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Iu≈øtice not able, or too proud to draw a Warrant him≈øelf.</p>
                  <p>Now by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> and ju≈øt rea≈øon, mens liberties being highly pri≈øed; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore men were to be tried the next Gaol delivery; I mean at the Se≈øsions for the County; but now by a Statute made in the time of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> or at lea≈øt under pretence of it, all matters criminal being death, that is, out of the Rogues City of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge; that is, to which they cannot readily plead guilty of all Felonies within Clergy, the ≈øtill continued ≈øhame of <hi>England;</hi> ≈øo that ≈øome u≈øe a hateful Proverb, (All Rogues to the Clergy, and all Clergy to the Gallows) they mu≈øt be tried at the ≈øo called A≈øsi≈øes.</p>
                  <p>This Statute was a great friend to the Clerk of the A≈øsize, above the Clerk of the Peace; and tho≈øe Iu≈øtices that will not ≈øee this Statute, the Inqui≈øitive Clerk of A≈øsi≈øe can ≈øpy his time to fit him if he cometh in his compa≈øs, which may be every A≈øsi≈øes; and though pre≈øent, put him down ab≈øent, ≈øo he is fined forty ≈øhillings; and to remedy it, will co≈øt twice ≈øo much.</p>
                  <p>Now in the Gaols, the Schools of Iniquity, they are not imployed; and if any one will imploy him≈øelf, he mu≈øt purcha≈øe his liberty to u≈øe his Trade at the Gaolers di≈øcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for there is no Law for it, no not for Debtors; ≈øo that having nothing to do, the Pri≈øoners confer notes; and the older Thief, Cutpur≈øe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ≈øtill in≈øtructs the yonger in the revealed quidities of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Vain people think highly of the≈øe nice eva≈øions of Law; but the ≈øerious ≈øees it makes the Law ridiculou≈øly difficult; the great Rogues ≈øcape, but the ignorant and unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced dye for it: All hone≈øt men love mercy, and are as loth ≈øimple Felony ≈øhould be death as any; but they would not men ≈øhould by Cu≈øtom abu≈øe ju≈øt things, or endure unlawful ones, or connive at wickedne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>Yet the≈øe and multitudes more well known, have long, and do ≈øtill pa≈øs unremedied, or are provided for but in part, or for a parcel of the Commonwealth; So that it is certain, the generalty of men which once come into <hi>Englands</hi> pri≈øons of all ≈øorts (as now u≈øed) are ≈øpoiled for ever, both as to indu≈øtry and hone≈øty; yea, ≈øo notorious is the evil, that I have known many Ju≈øtices avow, it was their ≈øorrow to be in place, to be in≈øtrumental to ≈øuch evils, by ≈øending one for his fir≈øt offence to Gaol, and likely to be amended; but ≈øent to Gaole (whither he mu≈øt go) he was irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably lo≈øt.</p>
                  <p>Now for maintenance in pri≈øon, originally in ≈øuch ca≈øes as the State was forfeited, as in Trea≈øons and Felonies which were tryed very ≈øpeedily, the State was ≈øeized by a publick Officer by way of ≈øecuring, and the wife and children if any were, continued in the hou≈øe, &amp;c. giving ≈øecurity the goods were not imbezeled, and nought removed or ≈øold, unle≈øs for the mainteance of the pri≈øoner, the forfeiture then reaching from the time of the fact committed; and then though this were ju≈øt, there was this inju≈øtice
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105181:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> that the forfeiture paid no debts, an unju≈øt and unchri≈øtian thing, yea if opened, the loo≈øe or inlet to abominable, cheating cozenage and knavery.</p>
                  <p>Now the Law is (that is, practice con≈øtant) that the pri≈øoner maintain him≈øelf, till him≈øelf, wife and children are undone, by ≈øelling all they have for the maintenance of the pri≈øoner, and paying Gaole Fees (though he be not guilty, a mo≈øt wicked thing) and this happily for acts or words no way Trea≈øonable, Felonious, &amp;c. or for ≈øuch matter, which none but a malicious Adver≈øary would have pro≈øecuted.</p>
                  <p>And to ≈øay the King paid his pri≈øoners Fees, is but to argue from matter of fact; for take a pri≈øon properly, it is but as a pound to dammagious bea≈øts, and in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per pound the owner mu≈øt provide for them, and they that offend mu≈øt provide for them≈øelves, or rely on charity; It is truth, it is but ju≈øt, that in ca≈øe of (≈øo called) il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal, or in ca≈øes dubious, whether baylable or not, or where baylable, yet for good cau≈øe denyed; and in all extraordinary impri≈øonments, that is, by ab≈øolute power in limited Monarchy, being cau≈øes for which the Law provided not, it ≈øeems rea≈øonable, that the ≈øame power that commits ≈øhould ≈øu≈øtain, untill the Law adjudges the offence; for in that ca≈øe the re≈øtraint of a Free-man ≈øeems puni≈øhment enough; now for ≈øuch a man how he comes into pri≈øon, that is, whether by the ordinary Officer of Ju≈øtice, as a Con≈øtable, or by an extraordinary hand, as by armed men, is not material; but the Quaere mu≈øt be rightly ≈øtated;</p>
                  <p>That is, whether in a time of full peace, no enemy appearing, nor to be feared, a Subject may be by Law arre≈øted by an Armed power; as to this it is ≈øaid, that con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Law to be the i≈ø≈øue of perfect rea≈øon, it is a matter worth mature advi≈øement; for the life of liberty lies in it, that is, the refuge of the Subject again≈øt the powers or authority, call them what you wil; for commonly the Souldiery are either in body, and ≈øo obey no common Arre≈øts and Proce≈ø≈øes of ≈øet Courts; or dibanded; and ≈øeldome an active man in his own County, and well known, will appear in acts of high di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priviledge; ≈øo that offenders in this kind are ≈øeldome worth ≈øuing upon a tre≈øpa≈øs, and the law of retaliation rather ≈øatiates the bruti≈øh then the manly pa≈ø≈øion or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bondage for ≈øatisfaction hath been hitherto exploded.</p>
                  <p>Others ≈øay, the crime is to be looked at, and then no matter who executes it; as in Felony, each man may by Law arre≈øt; and then if every man will, it is neither Riot nor Con≈øpiracy, what ever it may be called: Others rejoyn to both parts, and ≈øay that they are ≈øadly di≈øtre≈ø≈øed to ≈øee the various intere≈øts of per≈øons, leading one way to day, another to morrow, which their diver≈øity of opinions fully demon≈øtrate. They de≈øire plain truth with Iu≈øtice, and to that end they ≈øay that both are lawfull, time and per≈øon con≈øidered; and that this con≈øideration is and mu≈øt be left to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrate, who mu≈øt not ≈øtick ≈øo in the bare letter, that he lo≈øe the evident meaning of the Law, and ought to be puni≈øhed as a defaulter again≈øt his tru≈øt, ≈øhould he not in ≈øome cau≈øes u≈øe extraordinary power; for the Commonwealth mu≈øt not be without ≈øufficient power to defend it ≈øelf.</p>
                  <p>And therefore they ≈øay, that if the Law doth not provide for ≈øuch emergencies, he ought to be defaulted if he improves not his power to the di≈øcharge of his tru≈øt, that is the peace and ≈øafety of the Commonwealth, though he incurrs the lurch of the Law according to the old Letter.</p>
                  <p>The example was under the late King <hi>James</hi> at his comming to the Crown, when after the death of famous <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the County of <hi>York</hi> rai≈øed men and armed them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt a ≈øort of out-laws, which Act was by the letter of the Law Trea≈øon, &amp;c. but upon debate, wary enough, it was re≈øolved their duty, and they had their pardon; again≈øt which only ≈øome object, ≈øaying, that if in rea≈øon they offended not, why ≈øhould they be pardoned?</p>
                  <p>Now this is an≈øwered, others might el≈øe be imboldened without due cau≈øe, which ≈øay the objector's is nugatory; there is nothing of weight in the ca≈øe more then the Officers Fees of ≈øuing out the pardon; and to ≈øtop that ≈øcandal, let ≈øuch pardons i≈ø≈øue of cour≈øe by a day at the Officers penalty; ≈øo that the party ≈øhall not need pay for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; but as to the ca≈øe in hand, it is propounded, that in ca≈øes of doubting it were better to a≈ø≈øure all fears, to let the Souldier be but a≈ø≈øi≈øtant to the ≈øetled officer, and not u≈øed but in evident nece≈ø≈øity; but the thing is the ≈øame; I mu≈øt agree the pri≈øon may be any where by the law, which men in point of favour ea≈øily plead; but touched, then the Court of guard is a pri≈øon, then <hi>White-Hall,</hi> the head-quarters, every thing is odious;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105181:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> but were this ≈øame man put there under what he counted a civility, it ≈øhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; it may be therefore of great policy this was left in the Judges bre≈øt, to endear by ≈øuch circum≈øtantials where he ≈øaw cau≈øe; but this was altered upon good rea≈øon in part, and pri≈øons made publick, ≈øet, and certain, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The next thing is, to bring the pri≈øoner to his Tryal, wherein the Law as I ≈øaid, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring life, gives priviledges of no evident rea≈øon, in ca≈øe of crimes worthy of death, e≈øpecially the certain offendor pre≈øent.</p>
                  <p>Truth is, if the pretended Law of <hi>England</hi> did, as many of the Officers of it do, think one thing, and ≈øpeak another, tell them they are to dye, while the pri≈øoner knows Mr. Ordinary (≈øay the Judge what he will) will openly, prophanely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chri≈øtian-like of cour≈øe lye out a <hi>Legit</hi> (though he knows never a letter, and his con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence never grumble to give ≈øentence accordingly) it were not worthy que≈øtion, but evident rea≈øon being its guide, why ≈øhould they que≈øtion thirty ≈øix men without any cau≈øe, or with a wi≈øe Sheriff, &amp;c. is that ≈øo called priviledge ought at all? yet this in ≈øome ca≈øes is highly advanced; this pa≈øt, and that he is to plead, which ought to be openly, the doors not ≈øhut during the Tryal, (the Law of God, of <hi>England,</hi> common rea≈øon, and con≈øtant practice of Nations agrees it)</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, he may make all by the Law void in the Letter, by an appeal; yea I take it al≈øo without ≈øhewing any cau≈øe.</p>
                  <p>Next, by pleading to the Juri≈ødiction:</p>
                  <p>Next, by denying him≈øelf to be the party, with multitudes more, how evident ≈øoever.</p>
                  <p>Which Laws in the letter, being taken advantage of, as one for example; one fir≈øt called ≈øaid nothing, then ≈øhewed his name was not <hi>John,</hi> but <hi>John-as Jenkins,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not the party indicted: That amended, the Clerk goes on, <hi>John-as Jenkins</hi> of, &amp;c. he an≈øwers not after much debate; there is two Towns, one <hi>Hoph. Pet.</hi> the other <hi>Jo.</hi> and the Indictment is general, he knows not which; that agreed on, then his addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is mi≈øtaken, as he is Baronet, indicted Knight, or Knight and Baronet; but all agreed on, he is then to plead, and to this he pleads,</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, ≈øtrange dilatory pleas, as that the fact was done in another County, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe breeding great trouble and great delay, were both in Civil and Criminal ca≈øes in great part rectified; but ≈øo jealous was the Parliament ever of the thing called Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, that all was never done (though it may be the greater evils were removed) ≈øo that there are cau≈øes enough ≈øtill to dally in Law, to general di≈øadvantage of hone≈øt and publike good, and no liberty but of general capital offenders.</p>
                  <p>Now the rea≈øon of this was evident, becau≈øe the Subjects Liberty was by Princes ≈øought to be totally en≈ølaved; the be≈øt and wi≈øe≈øt were mo≈øt active in oppo≈øition, and to ≈øave the≈øe good men, we en≈ønarled the Law, and till now had never opportunity of rectification; if yet we have this ≈øeen by the Crown ≈øide, they engage three wayes, by Judges ab≈øolutely depending, A Jury of Conformi≈øts, and the general Plea, not guilty: And thus Prerogative and Priviledge fought; And ≈øurely the Law holds forth matter ≈øo clear in the Year-Books, on the one ≈øide by Pre≈øidents, Rights of Supremacy, di≈øpatch of bu≈øine≈øs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ≈øide, by Pre≈øidents, rea≈øon of Priviledge, for ≈øafety of Life, that the controver≈øie ≈øeems endle≈øs, and yet Ju≈øtice is plain; let him plead not guilty, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all give what other matter he can in evidence, which the Court ought to accept, and upon the whole matter, to give judgement, hearing him≈øelf and Councel; which ≈øurely if in any other Cau≈øe, Matter, or Plaint, a Subject ought to have, then much more in ca≈øe of life, e≈øpecially if the Law favors it; and more e≈øpecially where the Judges are the meer Dependants of the Prince or State; which jealou≈øie cannot be ≈øatisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, if withall other things can be ≈øuppo≈øed any way requirable; and therefore it hath been accounted for Law, that the Jury were not barely Judges of the fact; but were ≈øurely intended as a barr to Prerogative in ≈øome ≈øort or dependance thereon; for they may be without all doubt ≈øo far Judges, as to finde the matter ≈øpecially, will the Judge or nill he, and if them≈øelves will venture an attaint, may be Judges of the Law indeed again≈øt the plaine≈øt evidences.</p>
                  <p>So that it is evident the≈øe que≈øtions are ea≈øie to be controverted, and hard to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, yet not in them≈øelves, but only becau≈øe of the divers intere≈øts in this, as in mo≈øt matters in our Law, wherein the Crown had any hook, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105181:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> of their party, having laid foundations for their own benefits, and advancing their particular de≈øigns, which is the fir≈øt ri≈øe of the controver≈øie about the Militia, which never was in <hi>England</hi> in the Kings hand, otherwayes then that of Tenures, the <hi>po≈ø≈øe Comitatus</hi> being alwayes the proper defence of the County, and not ≈øubjugated to the Kings will or Royal Commi≈ø≈øion.</p>
                  <p>Now the rea≈øon was, War and Peace was nominally in the King, really in the Subject, becau≈øe of Moneys, which could not be charged without con≈øent in Parliament; ≈øome upon this, ground a Quaere of main concernment;</p>
                  <p>Namely, what are the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> or where to be found? Some as I have ≈øaid, an≈øwer, the Law of God; others ≈øay, excellent rea≈øon; ≈øome the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions peculiarized by u≈øe; others ≈øay with the Lawyers, That the Law of <hi>England</hi> is founded upon the Law of God, the Law of Rea≈øon, principles called Maximes, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtomes not contrary to rea≈øon, received time out of mind (and proper <hi>quarto modo</hi> to the people of the Nation) Statutes, and the re≈øolutions of the Judges: To this it is objected, that the≈øe generals teach or edifie not what the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>For the Quaere is, If the word of God, whether all, or part; if ≈øo, the infallible, or at lea≈øt certain Rule (pleadable) to know which part; they require the like certainty in rea≈øon, and the Expo≈øition of Principles and Cu≈øtomes; for they ≈øay all the≈øe mu≈øt ≈øolely depend upon the Iudges, and then the Law in their opinion is wholly Arbitrary; for if their only word makes it rea≈øon, and their only word determines the end and meaning of the principle; and ≈øo whether cu≈øtome be good or not, then it is meerly at the will of them; and this they ≈øay experience manife≈øted in the great Cau≈øe of Ship-Money, wherein had not the Sword been the better Arbiter of their priviledge, the ≈øentence had been irrevocable to en≈ølave them all to the King; Therefore they ≈øay, there mu≈øt be common rea≈øon, or ≈øome head-Rule, which mu≈øt judge mo≈øt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent rea≈øon, not that they intend vulgar deci≈øion, but a judgement mu≈øt be tryed by its conducing to publike good.</p>
                  <p>The Rule is; Good, the more general and common, ≈øo much the more precious; and from this they conclude all the≈øe heads of the Law of Nature or Rea≈øon, Principles, or Maxims, and Cu≈øtomes to be all the ≈øame with the <hi>dicta ≈øap.</hi> or re≈øolutions of the Judges; and then who≈øe creatures they are, and from whom they have their honour, pay, &amp;c. to them they will be bound, which they ca≈øt not by way of <hi>odium</hi> upon them, but common to them with all men to enforce and improve all their abilities by the fir≈øt principle of nature, to the pre≈øerving ≈øelf; and this they do, and better ≈øelf, in advancing the Title and Intere≈øt of them upon whom they depend.</p>
                  <p>But they ≈øay, this is as fatal a hawk to liberty to have ≈øuch an ab≈øolute depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon a State, as upon a Prince, tending to the ≈øame end of en≈ølaving the people,</p>
                  <p>Yea, reducing a State from a <hi>Democracie</hi> to a Tyranny, as well as from Royalty to Tyranny; for they ≈øay they have heard from Lawyers, and it is a general complaint, That the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are they know not what (at lea≈øt a wi≈øe, or ≈øo called Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Judge, may make them ≈øo, and that this is ea≈øilie≈øt done in matters of highe≈øt concernment.)</p>
                  <p>Take them to be the Law of God, no ≈øuch matter; where is ought according to that rule?

                  <p>Yea, all the rabble of Popi≈øh, Epi≈øcopal, and now ≈øo called Presbyterial Profe≈ø≈øors (that is, the baptized Chri≈øtian) are guilty of walking clean contrary to their profe≈ø≈øion, yet no way puni≈øhed; Gods Sabboth contemned; god-Mammon, that mental Adultery of Idolatry is mo≈øt of their ≈øin, common to them with their other brethren in the fle≈øh, by what names ≈øoever called or known.</p>

                  <p>But ≈øome ≈øay, ≈øome Judges make no con≈øcience of ≈øuch acts; they exemplifie, not only in Ship-Money, but in ordinary Tryals, while they deny ju≈øtice by delaying, and admitting the continuance of delayes in ju≈øtice, and ≈øometimes go again≈øt their own knowledge in the Law; as in the ca≈øe of admitting ≈øuch to read as they know cannot, and more evidently ≈øuch as are not capable by Law, as tho≈øe branded before, not once, but ≈øeven times, whereby the Rogue is as pre≈øerved, ≈øo encouraged; and this becau≈øe due notice is not taken of per≈øons branded in the Calender, nor Records penally pre≈øented in Court; to which, though ignorant per≈øons an≈øwer, they will not come there again, but act their Villainies in another County; wi≈øe men will not, who know the Law admits no going out (for it will prove wandring in ≈øuch of nece≈ø≈øity) but with Certificate; but the true rea≈øon, though it cannot wholly excu≈øe, is the be≈øt, namely, they think the Law too hard, and would rather have con≈øtant work-hou≈øes; but there is two evils in this ≈øo ju≈øt, ≈øo righteous a propo≈øal, to change this Law; for if either work-hou≈øes or due cour≈øe of certificates were ≈øetled, the Commonweale would be quickly rid of ≈øuch vermin.</p>
                  <p>But then the fir≈øt evil appears, namely, Clerks Fees would cea≈øe.</p>
                  <p>The next evil is the matter of charge in building, repairing, and maintaining the hou≈øes, and Officers, &amp;c. for a work-hou≈øe in this age, where building, back and belly cat up all, will hardly be maintained, much le≈øs rai≈øed; but to be well provided with ≈øtock and Over≈øeers, rather venture all.</p>
                  <p>There is complaint again≈øt our now Iudges taking Fees (if ≈øo they do) having yet 1000. l. <hi>per annum,</hi> that Fees might be di≈øcharged.</p>
                  <p>But the≈øe Complainers have one word more to the Law, that is, they ≈øay the great Charter of <hi>Normandy</hi> they own rather to be the old <hi>Norman</hi> Laws before <hi>William</hi> the Ba≈øtard, then the Law of <hi>England,</hi> though he might well labour to introduce the whole plot; Truth, it will ≈øerve to di≈øcover the Rea≈øons of our bondage, and that's all, which while Copyholds are not di≈øcarded, together with Crown Tenure, we are not freed of.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Fleta</hi> and <hi>Bracton,</hi> they ≈øay, they are the meer heads of <hi>Ju≈øtinians In≈øtitutes</hi> a little corrected according to the gui≈øe of <hi>Englands</hi> Principles of liberty above the Ancient Roman, or State of <hi>Greece</hi> in the height of the Empire;</p>
                  <p>Yet for that, exploded by the Kings Iudges. For <hi>Horn, Britton, Glanvil,</hi> they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted more <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> but may be as well <hi>Scotti≈øh, Sweadi≈øh,</hi> or <hi>Dani≈øh,</hi> e≈øpecially <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> who if compared with <hi>R.

                  <p>

                  <p>Yet they ≈øtill had their eva≈øions in ca≈øes of great intere≈øt, either for one Kings Title or other, for Prerogative or Priviledge, as particular re≈øpects engaged, and providence favoured, as was evident in the ca≈øe of <hi>R.</hi> 2. and his Iudges which lay a≈øleep from him, till our late <hi>Charls</hi> revived it, and ≈øuffered publickly for it, as <hi>Richard</hi> did privately; far the more manly and exemplary way of the two, and rational it is; for if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for man to give Law, he may and ought to enforce; and no way can be more con≈øentaneous to order, then that of the body Repre≈øentative, which is not in this ca≈øe denyed either by the Regular Presbyterian, or violent ≈øo called Interdependent; only they deny this a Parliament, as before is ≈øaid.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe Reporters wrot till <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh; there are ≈øome fragments of <hi>Henry</hi>

Lord <hi>Cook</hi> put out ≈øeveral Books of Reports, all which being principally matters of Title; or betwixt party and party, ≈øwam down ≈øtream: Now in mo≈øt of the≈øe were matters altered at plea≈øure; for out of the≈øe books it is ea≈øie to argue black white, and white black; Rea≈øon was cut into ≈øuch fine ≈øhreads of wit (and form which is as vain) that judgement was puzled to find ≈øomething where there was ≈øo much of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and if any thing were, it was ≈øo disjoynted a piece in 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. debated further 18<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. further, Proce≈øs in 23<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. and fini≈øhed 31<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Jan.</hi> 24<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>ultimo Regis Caroli Rex ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Brittannorum.</hi>

                  <p>Now for the Crown Law, of which we had no compleat Tract but <hi>Stamford,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cook</hi> treating of that particular and tacitly in his both Juri≈ødictions of Courts, and Expo≈øitions of Statutes, holding forth not only the bare letter, but a rational di≈øqui≈øition of the Texts, they al≈øo were e≈øtopped; and well is it, ≈øay ≈øome, if they have not met with a concealed Dominicane Expurgator, or Je≈øuitical Emendator, there being ≈øuch hard hold on all ≈øides, for them, and again≈øt them, ≈øince pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe things re≈øented as grievances in the Kings times, and promi≈øes to be ruled better then under the be≈øt of Kings; the King gone, the enquiry and expectation is, what alteration.</p>
                  <p>If we quaere among the Profe≈ø≈øors, O Lord what cau≈øe is given to the Adver≈øary to bla≈øpheme, while many ≈øeeming Saints, earne≈øt Profe≈ø≈øors and zealous above multitudes, count God a mockery, his Scriptures politick ob≈øervations of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall men!</p>
                  <p>The Devil, every man that is oppo≈øite to their wor≈øe then Heatheni≈øm; and how few glorifie the Lord in the≈øe things, and magnifie his mercies to them, that they are not withdrawn, but rather make u≈øe of it, through the ≈øubtilty of Satan, to upbraid the Truth with Error and Here≈øie, Contradiction and Confu≈øion; and the≈øe a≈ø≈øure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, that the godly wi≈øe Bi≈øhops fore≈øaw this evil which is now befallen the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God, and admire their way, when they and their way are peri≈øhed together with their revenues, which were according to their own method totally aboli≈øhed; only the ≈øeat of the Bea≈øt is by providence re≈øerved, to what end I will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈øie; And who mourns in ≈øecret for the≈øe things? In the Commonwealth they ≈øee little; but hope, though the un≈øea≈øonable oppo≈øitions hinder at pre≈øent, they ≈øhall ≈øee it in due time effected.</p>
                  <p>If you look at the other party of Profe≈ø≈øors, whether Congregational or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, their jealou≈øies are as great; and notwith≈øtanding the Independent (≈øo called) had the right hand of fellow≈øhip in the pre≈øent power, and was not ≈øo rigid towards the Presbyter; yet the root of oppo≈øition ≈øprouted, though I hope the light of grace will nip it the bud.</p>
                  <p>But the Presbyters intere≈øt is the root of the image, the ≈øtump, and will not ea≈øily yield, I mean humane prudence to be admitted the Church.</p>
                  <p>But look to the ordinary Pari≈øh Prie≈øt, of what opinion ≈øoever, they are as di≈øaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in the generality to God and goodne≈øs as before; for as in branding the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie Rogue, there was no Regi≈øter, ≈øo that the Rogue had priviledge ≈øix or ≈øeven times; ≈øo the ejected Clergy for want of regi≈øtring and tran≈ømitting to every Committee the ejection, the ≈øcandalizing ones are admitted five, ≈øix or ≈øeven times over; and let a ≈øtander by judge; he cannot find this to be done upon any rational ground, other then more work for the Committee, and ≈øo more fees for the Clerks.</p>
                  <p>And if it were not ≈øuch li≈øtening or tru≈øting to Clerks, what could draw from ≈øuch wi≈øe men, ≈øober, grave, and outwardly pious, things ≈øo di≈ø≈øonant from rea≈øon, and their profe≈ø≈øion, and the intention of their original con≈øtitution, by this means as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable or the like? the work is great, much done, and never the neerer an end; for
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105181:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> turn them out of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> they go into <hi>Suffolk,</hi> thence to <hi>Lincoln,</hi> &amp;c. And ju≈øt and good men are ejected upon ≈ømall matters rather then contend.</p>
                  <p>And the pious zealous Chri≈øtian again≈øt the evil one is tired out with vexation of minde, labour of body, and pur≈øe-paiment under renewed evils of the ≈øame ≈øtamp; ≈øo that the mo≈øt and wor≈øt ≈øtill remain, and many ill ones new ≈øetled, they are di≈øcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the removal; and the great root of this is Tythes, which tis clear for the Par≈øons ≈øake few regard; but the chief man favoured is the rich Impropriator; I pray, is not Tythes more due (according to the original ground of Tythes) to the Prie≈øt, then the Patron, or Lay-per≈øon; by the old Levitical analogie, then <hi>Hen.</hi> the Eights new policie? is the old inheritance in Par≈øon, Patron, and Ordinary, of le≈øs ≈øtrength, or le≈øs inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then that in the impropriator, who hath but upon grant upon a politike forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? or is it not evident to Rea≈øon by the rules of Scripture, Law, and Rea≈øon, that he is not capable of them?</p>
                  <p>He is not the labourer, not the Ox, not his lips that pre≈øerves knowledge, not Gods Husbandman, and him≈øelf dares not own either Evangelical, Pa≈øtoral, or Prie≈øtly Office; and it were well he practi≈øed but as an ordinary Chri≈øtian: but it is ≈øaid, the rea≈øon of all is Intere≈øt; for the light hath manife≈øted Tythes no way due to the Go≈øpel, nor any certainty but a ≈øufficiency; yet this ≈øufficiency re≈øting in the arbitriment of the people, but the≈øe gathered into Churches, and the Church is then a Judge: Some from the in≈øpection of error, pa≈øt, and pre≈øent, that is, the general ungodline≈øs which is in men, fear that Tythes put down, there would be no maintenance allowed, and the ≈øame confu≈øion would follow, as in <hi>Germany,</hi> the be≈øt Mini≈øter mo≈øt contemned, therefore they are continued; this argument is agreed a principal motive to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue them.</p>
                  <p>But it is an≈øwered, That the ground-work is too weak; the Di≈øciple is not better then his Ma≈øter, nor <hi>Englands</hi> Pa≈øtor then the whole worlds Apo≈øtles; there is no command for it; why then enforced, and that to them who Preach not, Preach evilly; per≈øons not qualified according as the Go≈øpel holds out, either in the fir≈øt of <hi>Timothy</hi> the third; or in the fir≈øt of <hi>Tit.</hi> 9. but commonly all contrary.</p>
                  <p>Neither are the per≈øons qualified in the promi≈øcuou≈øne≈øs of Pari≈øhes as the brethren ought to be by the Word of God, yet the≈øe duties enforced; therefore ≈øay they, ≈øo long as the≈øe corrupt intere≈øts are, there can be no propagation of the Go≈øpel; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øult not onely every Friday, but all the week; they agree the common liberty (which is the intere≈øt) is a great mercy of God, but if not ≈øorting with intere≈øt, if matters mend not, they fear intere≈øt may take away, as well as give liberty; they hope better, but in the fluctuations of matters they fear; let the cau≈øe of complaint be taken away, and they will count it their ≈øin to complain.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ≈øee the Church ≈øo called generally as it was.</p>
                  <p>A ≈øhort view of the Commonwealth, and we will leave our Hi≈øtorical part.</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, in the ≈øo called Parliament (as men commonly term it) a few onely exi≈øtent, the onely accu≈øed kept out (no further charge, no legal expul≈øion, nor new admi≈ø≈øion, nor no way of ejecting members by their Repre≈øentors in ca≈øe of failer of duty, as Non-attendance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They advi≈øe to remember how many went to the building the material Temple; therefore they would rather then eject, double the number) So that many Counties have no Repre≈øentatives admitted, others not appearing; and there being fal≈øe principles in all e≈øtates, degrees, per≈øons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are jealous that our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators may not be wholly pure, e≈øpecially they having heard of the great ≈øtrife men make in Parliament for the advantage of the places for which they are cho≈øen; and he is highlie≈øt accounted of, who benefits more his particular tru≈øt, then the general good of the Nation: men may, as they have been, be carried away; they fear much, and therefore de≈øire a filling of the hou≈øe by an equal Repre≈øentative, not de≈øirous at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of a new, to avoid ≈øome fatal evils that are fore≈øeen in the ≈øame.</p>
                  <p>In ca≈øe of the Coun≈øel of State, which they oppo≈øe not, they onely de≈øire it may be ≈øo limited, that it grow not from an Oligarchy into a Tyranny, which gives ju≈øt cau≈øe of fear, while of Parliament men, and tho≈øe perpetual, and no power vi≈øible to que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they are not re≈øpon≈øal for any wrong, and to put any into office with them, not Parliament men, and ≈øo re≈øpon≈øal, except their brethren in power beat them out; there is inju≈øtice that one ≈øhould an≈øwer, another not for the ≈øame fault.</p>
                  <p>They rather de≈øire ≈øome fit way of choi≈øe, of one man out of every County in the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105181:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> Nation; from them come to Committees delays; the complaint now foreruns the new in≈øtituted Committee of Accompts; all Receivers, Trea≈øurers, Collectors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will have fine work, no Rule, Order, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but bare <hi>placet</hi> of <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Officers of Seque≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will have the be≈øt ≈øhare of trouble, who have accounted in the County to the Sub-Committee of Seque≈øtrations among them≈øelves to the Sub-committee of Accounts there; Now all mu≈øt account at Gold≈ømiths Hall, and then to the new Catholike Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Accounts, as if Officers were but to drive a Trade of maintenance by whole ≈øale and retaile, from one ≈øhilling <hi>per</hi> pound to nine pence, then to ≈øix pence, then to four pence, three pence, two pence, one penny <hi>per</hi> pound; and that drawn out again in two, three, four, five, ≈øix, ≈øeven, eight, nine pence, <hi>&amp;c. per</hi> ≈øheet, to Writers, Clerks, Accountants, all after the form of the corrupt Commonwealth pa≈øt.</p>
                  <p>There are hone≈øt men of all ≈øides ≈øay, That they fear no policy will prevail again≈øt truth, that is, they hope, though it be ≈øo feared; upon which they offer to confideration, whether it were ought but corrupt intere≈øt that made good men bad Bi≈øhops? And whether it will not upon the ≈øame Rule make good men corrupt Officers of all ≈øorts; therefore they hate as much to hear of one ≈øhilling <hi>per</hi> pound, as of Patents during plea≈øure; or to ≈øome for three years, while all are not ≈øo; and then not capable of ≈øo many years more; for the remote contingent dependance is evil, though not ≈øo evil as the more immediate and ab≈øolute: Indeed there is a great complaint, that not onely things complained of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> remain ≈øtill the ≈øame, but grow wor≈øe; Inns, Taverns and Alehou≈øes multiply, to the out daring Ju≈øtice; irregularity in all Trades, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neglect of all inferior Powers in ordinary Juri≈ødiction; The orders i≈ø≈øue, That all is left to be done according to Law; but that ≈øo dilatory and difficult, that no wi≈øe and hone≈øt man dare meddle with it, ≈øo that many faint and ≈øay, what they expected to be be the Lords deliverance is his Bondage; many while in the Wilderne≈øs, wi≈øh they were in <hi>Egypt</hi> again: there are that call for Kingly Government (as you well perceive.)</p>
                  <p>Yet were they the in≈øtruments to his overthrow, vain and impatient ≈øpirits; ≈øome rebell again≈øt you to make them≈øelves high, indeed like <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, for they ≈øay, What are you, that you ≈øhall raign over us?</p>
                  <p>Therefore they ≈øay, Let the old Race come in again, let not up≈øtarts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now the≈øe are the Lords Remembrancers to you; you are of the ≈øame frame and temper with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men; And you know mans condition ≈øince his fall, he hath ≈øhaken off the pure Law of Righteou≈øne≈øs, as an in≈øupportable Tyranny, and we are wholly led away of our own lu≈øts, and <hi>Satan ≈ønares us under the notion of Liberty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus are we become mighty in mi≈øchief, the devils policies are ea≈øily learned; but his ≈øtratagems difficulty, if at all, but by grace di≈øcovered; this makes us more ≈øubtile to deceive our ≈øelves then others; but God a≈ø≈øuredly will not, cannot be mocked; this makes many fear mercies are given for a ≈ønare, that is, for future and greater Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (which the Lord prepare us for, if ≈øo determined; but if it be his gratious Will prevent by our returnings.)</p>
                  <p>By all which now it is evident, that the Apo≈øtacy and defection hath over ≈øpread both Churches and Nations; the people of God, as well as the men of the world; that this Apo≈øtacy hath been, yea is in <hi>England</hi> &amp;c ≈øtill working as vigorou≈øly, if not more then ever: Satan now rages, and the chaffer of the Whore is not yet expul≈øed the Camp of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øtone hewn out of the Mountain without hands in the Regiment of the Lord Je≈øus, hath been rejected as Chylia≈øtical, a notion too ob≈øtru≈øe in learned Scripture ≈øen≈øe, how plain ≈øo ever in the vulgar letter.</p>
                  <p>All that I ≈øay to them ≈øo reject it, yet look for Chri≈øts coming, is, let them take heed, that as the <hi>Jews</hi> eyes were blinded in looking for a Prince, and lo a Servant; That we be not blinded in ≈øtill looking at a Servant Chri≈øt when he will be exalted, le≈øt in ≈øtead of one we rai≈øe up many Antichri≈øts, and ≈øet them in the Seat of God.</p>
                  <p>I would not be mi≈øtaken, I plainly mean with what limitations we intend the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrate to be the keeper of the Keys, which I fear can re≈øt in no mans hand but the Lord Chri≈øt's, let him have all the power the Pope, or Bi≈øhop, or Clergy could claim.</p>
                  <p>But I ≈øay, the fellow≈øhips of Saints are freed from the enforcing power over con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>de Jure,</hi> though all evils (as well as ≈øins) may befall them with others for di≈øobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to unju≈øt Laws <hi>de facto;</hi> You whom God hath called out to the work, have a

                  <p>
                     <hi>England</hi> offers it ≈øelf as a white Paper to receive any Print; you need not at pre≈øent out of fears of a change pretend a new Repre≈øentative to quiet ≈øpirits; No, the people are as the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> feared enough with the thundrings, lightnings and Trumpet of quarterings, Seque≈øtrations, and dilatory attendances, that they are re≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ≈øpeak you like <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> to God for them, and what he ≈øaith they will hear; there are ≈øome or other particulars ready to fly out, and ≈øay as <hi>Corah,</hi> Am not I as good as you, as wi≈øe, learned, vertuous, godly? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in impatience of ≈øpirit.</p>
                  <p>But ble≈ø≈øed be God, all the Congregation have not yet ≈øaid as they, You have ≈ølain the people of the Lord: We know, ≈øay ≈øome, the difficulty of the Work, if there were no oppo≈øition; how much mu≈øt there then be where there is ≈øo much? ≈øit not ≈øtill, find time to ≈øettle lea≈øt God take you away; let's at lea≈øt ≈øee the fruits of your labours; and if you think it not yet the time of Chri≈øts per≈øonal, yet it be of his vertual Raign here; let there be a plain, ≈øure, certain, ea≈øie, ≈øettlement of affairs with that charitable affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that ≈øociable, ≈øuitable behaviour; that clearne≈øs, and that in ≈øimplicity which by the Laws of Nature is due to our fellow creatures.</p>
                  <p>Enforce unju≈øt men to ca≈øt away the ma≈øque of hypocri≈øie in ≈øimulations of Piety and vertue, to gain advantage to ≈øavage gripings and extortions.</p>
                  <p>If you cannot allow the heights of the Go≈øpel-Liberty, allow us but a ju≈øt ≈øettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the evident principles of natural equity, or ruled by (to avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øts) the Mo≈øaical Judicials as the boundary, or pre≈øcribe your own way; this will admit ≈øatisfaction to many intere≈øts; and if rightly regulated, none in them≈øelves cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, el≈øe we deny our holy Profe≈ø≈øion; <hi>For the grace of God that brings ≈øalvation unto all men hath appeared, And it teacheth us to deny ungodline≈øs and worldly lu≈øts, and that we ≈øhould live righteou≈øly, ≈øoberly and godly in this pre≈øent life;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Looking for the ble≈ø≈øed hope and appearing of the glory of the mighty God, who gave him≈øelf for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purge us to be a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to him≈øelf zealous of good works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the≈øe good works are ≈øhortly laid down in the Go≈øpel thus, in obedience to Principalities and powers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that not onely Kings, but inferior Magi≈øtrates, yea Husbands, Parents, Ma≈øters; yea, to Teachers, Elders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or any ≈øett over them, of, or in the Lord, taking care for all ≈øorts of per≈øons in the relations political, both Publike and Dome≈øtick; and al≈øo in ≈øpiritual: Its truth, the qualifications of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrates under the Go≈øpel are not directly ≈øpoken unto in the Go≈øpel, which gives a ground to ≈øome to altercate, whether Magi≈øtracy may be under the Go≈øpel.</p>
                  <p>But Generals may ≈øometimes be gathered from particulars; the principal ≈øcope tis true of the Go≈øpel ≈øhews the worlds enmity with the Spirit, and the ≈øpecial enmity re≈øts in the Princes; Powers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The≈øe are the men with their carnal intere≈øt.</p>
                  <p>But the Powers ≈øimply con≈øidered, cannot by that be oppo≈øed; for becau≈øe I will not admit an evil Magi≈øtrate that is a terror to the good, ≈øhall I not allow him that is a terror to the bad? becau≈øe it was a ≈øhame that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> went to Law before Heathen Judges, ≈øhall each one do what is right in his own eyes?</p>
                  <p>No; St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Let's not ≈øin that grace may abound, includes much; And ≈øo that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of an Elder of a Church; tho≈øe mental excellencies, ≈øoul-beautifyings of a ≈øpiritual Ruler; no Mitre, Crown, Bells, Pomegranates, Brea≈øt-plate, Ephod, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be allowed; no outward blemi≈øh; Though that was admitted among ≈øome Bi≈øhops of the Primitive Church, is now ju≈øt exception.</p>
                  <p>If ≈øuch purity in Elders for the Church, then ≈øurely al≈øo for the State: by this all the Typed Mo≈øaical qualifications, and more al≈øo are required; Indeed, the words are mean and low; but the meaning is tran≈øcendent; I ≈øhall therefore ≈øhortly, according as the grace of God gives me, give a ≈øhort e≈ø≈øay to the principles of a Chri≈øtian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and re≈øolve mo≈øt of the≈øe Quaeries which here ≈øeem but barely controverted without determining.</p>
                  <p>I truely faint under the burden, knowing my own weakne≈øs, and the mighty wi≈ødom which I know in ≈øome, whom I cannot believe, think an alteration nece≈ø≈øary, while they have accepted ≈øo great places of honor and profit, in what I mu≈øt think wholly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105181:53"/> corrupt, and the world calls the prophane Commonwealth, or Babel in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate; that is, they are feared principally to adore the Amu≈øive part of Ju≈øtice in the formalities of Robes, as Judges Caps, Furrs, Blacks, Serjeants Gowns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ≈øame with Rochets, Caps, Hoods, Gowns, Tippets, Surplices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So for Officers of Courts, ≈øo for Appeals, the ≈øame for dependances upon the Supream Magi≈øtrate in degrees by way of variety of Courts, Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in the Bi≈øhops cour≈øe, from the Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors and Arch-Deacons Courts to the High Commi≈ø≈øion.</p>
                  <p>So in the Presbyterian way, according to the cour≈øe of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhional to the National A≈ø≈øembly; All which hath in it but a form of Ju≈øtice, and is delu≈øory: nece≈ø≈øaries I admit, but no more: I affect not the <hi>Laconick</hi> har≈øhne≈øs, nor the <hi>Stoical</hi> ≈øuper≈øtition, nor the <hi>Anabapti≈øtical</hi> confu≈øion, nor the <hi>Per≈øian</hi> pomp and vanity.</p>
                  <p>Yet I think it was the more honor for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that they were learned, valorous, and free, though with little pomp or o≈øtentation, then to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> that they were pompous and bond≈ølaves; rich, but had nothing their own, cowardly and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, obedient even to ≈øhadows; an Ape or Hound of the Kings in the formality ≈øhould have ruled them as well as the King him≈øelf, for they were ignorant: I would therefore have Order to prevent confu≈øion; Obedience flow from Knowledge in civil things, as from Faith in divine, yet all for con≈øcience ≈øake; otherwi≈øe the Law will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go further then half way, and that will rule and per≈øwade where no Promoter or Officer of State can.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I ≈øay, pretending to a Chri≈øtian Commonwealth, I there explode all bare Forms, they are above them; nece≈ø≈øary Forms are admitted, for they mu≈øt be, but Forms of bare intere≈øt cannot, will not.</p>
                  <p>Happily you will ≈øay, This will put the Magi≈øtrate to a demur, whether then he ≈øhould have two Forms to govern by in the ≈øame Nation, but that Quaere will be u≈øele≈øs.</p>
                  <p>For it is intended the Chri≈øtian Magi≈øtrate ≈øhould wave all tho≈øe Amu≈øions, and onely in the power of Righteou≈øne≈øs do Iu≈øtice, keep the Law of God with his whole heart, make it his ≈øtudy; and due execution of Law, and propagating the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it in an ea≈øie civil Chatechi≈øtical way will ≈øoon ≈øhew, that Form is a very Idol, no more then the Godde≈øs Opinion; to which I fear not to ≈øay, they ≈øacrifice who ≈øo much exalt Form. Now know Forms are al≈øo in delayes; as not to give Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a plain Ca≈øe of Law the ≈øame day it is complained of; it is Cu≈øtome not Form to weep lamentably upon the Bench at the giving ≈øentence of death, when this pa≈ø≈øion ari≈øes not from compunction of ≈øoul, but weakne≈øs of Spirit, and this weakne≈øs is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced by no care for ≈øoul after ≈øentence pa≈øt.</p>
                  <p>It is then therefore ≈øu≈øpected to tend ≈øpecially to ≈øelf intere≈øt. Truly our ≈øweet Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Iu≈øtice are imbittered; we looked with the Prophet for Iu≈øtice, but its turned into mourning; for Righteou≈øne≈øs, but behold a Cry; the exce≈ø≈øive Fees of all ≈øorts, the Selfi≈øh formal hearings, the dilatory attendances, the u≈øual ≈øquee≈øing, griping Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as Under≈øheriffe, Baillffs, Regi≈øters, Clerks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all continued, whereby the poor is ≈øold for nothing, and Iu≈øtice at the rate of Cu≈øtoms, and Clerks Fees, which I nor no man can call a bribe.</p>
                  <p>O you that ≈øit in Seats of Iu≈øtice, beware; the Lord hath a controver≈øie with the mighty, and to pull down tho≈øe in his glory, he doth it in Iu≈øtice, and his Iudgements are true; good intentions ≈øo called, will not excu≈øe before him that ≈øearcheth hearts, yea to the dividing of ≈øoul and ≈øpirit.</p>
                  <p>Know this you great men, if you ≈øeek to uphold any intere≈øt again≈øt the Lord, it will down; yea, your own hands ≈øhall work your own overthrow, you may have ≈øeen it in the mighty works of God hitherto; and if you will not perceive it by whom it is de≈øired, the merciful hand of God to you in correcting of others, he can ≈øoon lay the rod upon your ≈øhoulders al≈øo; and think not that becau≈øe God gave you long ≈øince to ≈øee this change, and then to ≈øeek him and his glory, and that he hath (if he hath) made you in≈øtrumental to him in this his work, or thereby, or hath given you places of honour or great profit at pre≈øent, that therefore you are in the right, and under his protection.</p>
                  <p>No, then you mu≈øt break every yoak, and pluck down every Idol, and labour to bow all intere≈øts, and powers, to be ≈øubject to the ≈øole Regiment of the Lord in truth and righteou≈øne≈øs, and in ≈øo doing, the grace of our Lord God will be with you, and guide you by his grace to glory.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:105181:53"/>
                  <p>O Lord, let the prayers of thy ≈øervants for this be heard of thee, and make all men through thy power to improve every place, talent, and opportunity to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy Truth in Righteou≈øne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>There is now but one word concerning the Court of Chancery, which was the Court of equity for the Subject in general, as that of the ≈øo called Reque≈øts was in his proper nature for the relief of the Kings Servants upon any equitable matter ari≈øing within the verge of the Court, where at lea≈øt one party was to be the Kings menial Servant, however the pretended nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øome, and reall of others abu≈øed it.</p>
                  <p>But that of the Reque≈øts gone, let us hear the opinions of men concerning that of the Chancery; and they ≈øay, that this Court of Con≈øcience is grown as uncon≈øcion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as any; and the intere≈øt of profit to the particular Officers is as great and as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructive to publike good as of any Court, if not more; for ≈øuits in Chancery, are as common and as obnoxious as Writs of Error.</p>
                  <p>They ≈øay, the u≈øe of the Court is intentionally ju≈øt, that is, that where accidents which could not be fore≈øeen nor avoided, ca≈øts the right the contrary way to what the ju≈øtice of the Law intended, that it ≈øhould be there remedied.</p>
                  <p>But they ≈øay, this ought fir≈øt to appear at the Common Law, and then the whole matter tran≈ømitted from the Judges there to the Chancery, to be there decreed ≈øhortly.</p>
                  <p>Now the matters proper to that Court, can generally be manife≈øted by no better an example then by tho≈øe for which a man is E≈ø≈øoinable at Common Law (upon duty of appearance, however that is made now a cou≈øe of practice al≈øo, and E≈ø≈øoyns are of cour≈øe, for the whole Law is perverted) whereas now men are to≈ø≈øed from Common Law to Chancery, and then to Common Law again, and no end of Suit, and the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ≈øo great, and i≈ø≈øue ≈øo uncertain, that Free-Quarter was not more ruining then ≈øeeking right; for who can prefer a Bill under three pounds? and then for a Copy, the Defendant he mu≈øt pay eight pence a ≈øheet, and ≈øix pence thereof goes to the ≈øo called Six Clerks for taking out the Bill, which are places valued at about two, ≈øome ≈øay ≈øix thou≈øand pounds a year; and if he can write, he ≈øets his name to it; examine it he ≈øhould; but it is not beleeved any one of them looks on one ≈øheet of a thou≈øand; and if he did, were it worth <hi>ob.</hi> to read it, if but two pence to write it? Take a Copy from the Plaintif you cannot, though he would ≈øo favour you; you cannot put in your An≈øwer till that due be paid.</p>
                  <p>After the An≈øwer, cometh an Injunction that mu≈øt be moved for; there is ten, if not twenty, thirty, fourty ≈øhillings oft, three pounds in eminent Ca≈øes, and to eminent men, that is, one great in power, as in Offices of Honor, or highly favoured: This Injunction comes to eighteen ≈øhillings; why not for one ≈øhilling all of cour≈øe? I have ≈øeen Orders made by tho≈øe honorable men now ≈øitting tending to it; but By-practizers hear they are detrimental to private profit, and ≈øo the Orders are abroad to catch birds to the lure. You may now ≈øue at a better rate, the Court hath reformed; but come to try, and you mu≈øt pay as before.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe Six Clerks are wholly needle≈øs; the Regi≈øter alone can do the work; but particular Judges, Keepers, &amp;c. mu≈øt not make the≈øe orders in any Court, they will be overballanced, or may be; for generally they have been.</p>
                  <p>It mu≈øt be enacted into a Law, That the Subject may require it as his due, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and have, not only redre≈øs, but ≈øatisfaction; References to the pretended Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters are wor≈øe, as more dilatory, but ought not to be ≈øo expen≈øive, by rea≈øon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter ought to take but half a Crown.</p>
                  <p>Now I like that Ma≈øter be≈øt that will clearly ≈øay, I have viewed all, and ≈øee the right, and will report it, you ≈øee my great trouble and pains, you know my due is but two ≈øhillings ≈øix pence, I will do you right; for my recompence I leave it to you as you are a Gentleman.</p>
                  <p>Too little wages is a wrong and a ≈ønare to any ≈øervant, much more a publick one, and mo≈øt to a judicial one, or in≈øtrumentall thereto; all ears hear complaints; but I who cannot accu≈øe, will not charge, though I may beleeve there is ≈øome fire where there is ≈øo much ≈ømoak.</p>
                  <p>I will reckon up no more of the Six Clerks tricks to the perplexity of the practizing Clerk, and detriment of the Clyent; this alone is enough.</p>
                  <p>Nor will I alledge ought more for the Court, then that old Rule of the Learned,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:105181:54"/> which none but the Learned can under≈øtand; There is no remedy in the Chancery for what there is no remedy at Common Law. But now, for poor people not worth ten pounds in the world, quiet per≈øons, to be ≈øued by contentious knaves, how ≈øhall they bear the charge? for though that the Subject Defendant is (contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs rule of Law) admitted of cour≈øe to take out a <hi>Dedimus,</hi> whereby their journey to <hi>London</hi> is ≈øaved, yet when they come but to take out the Bill at eight pence <hi>per</hi> ≈øheet, before they can take a <hi>Dedimus,</hi> and next pay after the rate of eight pence a ≈øheet again for writing the Bill in the <hi>Dedimus,</hi> which alone is the evident great gain of the practizing Clerk, half the e≈øtate of the party is gone.</p>
                  <p>O the intolerable oppre≈ø≈øion that is among≈øt Chri≈øtians! I fear all the Turks and Heathens in the world will not own ≈øo much; I admire not, if any height of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs be objected to a Turk, his dete≈øtation of it is expre≈ø≈øed thus (Do you think me to be a Chri≈øtian?)</p>
                  <p>The ≈øharking of the Subject by feigned recoveries, and by the great ado to relea≈øe womens e≈øtates, at ≈øuch chargeable rates, only to maintain a company of idle bellies, and nouri≈øh corrupt dependencies, is of a like ≈øtrain.</p>
                  <p>And though the Verdict by twelve men be accounted the chief flower, or one of the chiefe≈øt in the Garland of <hi>Englands</hi> Liberties; yet I mu≈øt ≈øay the ba≈øene≈øs of men is ≈øuch, that it is one of the mo≈øt de≈øtructive; for there is no con≈øcience of an oath with the mo≈øt; and though it be vi≈øible, there is no due puni≈øhment.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, you that are at the Stern, whom God hath lifted up in the height of his power, and placed in ≈øeats of Eminency, do not trifle away your precious time, let ≈øpeedy care be taken to ≈øettle this poor di≈øtracted Nation; look not to your own works, and let the Lords lie ≈øtill; there appeared in you a ≈øtrong dependance upon God; give not wicked men cau≈øe to bla≈øpheme; Rowze up your ≈øelves, and con≈øider God hath a controver≈øie with the Nation, and will not be appea≈øed with all Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, except Ju≈øtice and Righteou≈øne≈øs be done.</p>
                  <p>Let the Complaints of the poor, afflicted, di≈øtre≈ø≈øed come to your ears, who have great wrongs, injuries, and oppre≈ø≈øions, and none to relieve them.</p>
                  <p>Yea, let the cryes of quiet peaceable men come to your ears, who are oppre≈ø≈øed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becau≈øe not willing to return evil for evil, rayling for rayling, ≈øtroak for ≈øtroak, action for action:</p>
                  <p>To ≈øue, is to perplex their minds, ruine their e≈øtates, if they have it, and bring them at lea≈øt to a wanting condition, who lived well; not to ≈øue, to be ≈øued and forced to compound at the legal Theeves Will.</p>
                  <p>If poor, the Law is chargeable, equity unrea≈øonable, and get a Lord Chief Ju≈øtice (Warrant ≈øo called) Order of Reference, it is derided, not obeyed, after much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, lo≈øs of time, and ≈øome expence by the poor Sutor.</p>
                  <p>You are on earth in Gods place, and mu≈øt to him give an account; let not your eyes ≈øleep till the≈øe works of Righteou≈øne≈øs be ≈øetled.</p>
                  <p>There is great complaint of Inns, Alehou≈øes, Taverns, &amp;c. encrea≈øing under your Regiment; for the Lords ≈øake look ≈øpeedily about you, let not your Officers, as the Kings, ≈øet your honor to ≈øale for the increa≈øe of their Fees; you are yet in a ≈ølippery place; the promi≈øes and engagements upon you are great, and the expectations of the people high; and tho≈øe mo≈øt con≈øiderable of your own party, are the highe≈øt; their ≈øpirits breath after ju≈øt Liberty, they ≈øee how you to≈øs and tumble all the Rubbi≈øh of the Government of the world, to find fit ≈øtones for your building; Truly, they dare ≈øay, among all the Chri≈øtian Princes, practi≈øed Rules, Edicts, Orders; Statutes, Laws, &amp;c. you cannot find materials enough to lay one ≈øtep to the Throne of pure Ju≈øtice, in the ≈øupremacy of power; and they therefore much fear le≈øt you ≈øhould ≈øtumble at the ≈øame ≈øtone of offence with them, and place the excellency of your eminency in power to do, rather then doing Ju≈øtice; and when you get a little ≈øtrength, to ≈øtand on your ≈øelves, to think, and by power make good, you are as they accountable to none but God; there is no clearne≈øs in the walkings and actings of men, becau≈øe yours are not ≈øo.</p>
                  <p>But mo≈øt will hope as they pray, for better things; and although they knowing the great burthens which are upon your ≈øhoulders, cannot de≈øire ≈øo much as ≈øome do, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they, nor dare they (as others) think, much le≈øs ≈øay (mo≈øt likely to render your actions odious) that you ≈øeek nothing but your ≈øelves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:105181:54"/> you do not all that is de≈øired, therefore cry out, you ≈øit to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>No, all may ≈øee you have done great things; but it is de≈øired, that ≈øome things of conceived nece≈ø≈øity for your e≈øtabli≈øhment be ≈øpeedily ordered, until with the whole they may be in due time e≈øtabli≈øhed or ≈øetled.</p>
                  <p>As fir≈øt for the breeding up of all youth, that all Schools be ≈øupplyed with able, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt, and religious School-ma≈øters, all according to one form and rule ≈øetled by the Supream Magi≈øtrate.</p>
                  <p>And ≈øo the Univer≈øities, where the youth are yet rather poy≈øoned then profited; and though the humerous conceit of Caps and Capping, and ≈øuch like be ju≈øtly waved, that ≈øuch a decency be ordered in the habits of youths, as may not adapt the mind to licentiou≈øne≈øs (many wi≈øe men placing much in things of that nature) and to that end that all youths habits (of both ≈øexes) at lea≈øt may be ordered throughout the whole Nation, but e≈øpecially apprentices and ≈øervants of all ≈øorts.</p>
                  <p>So as at lea≈øt to di≈øtingui≈øh, not ≈øhame; that of ≈øhame only affronting, not reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and for all ≈øervants to be admitted their ≈øervices by Te≈øtimonial under a penalty to the Ma≈øter or Dame; their wages to be ≈øet by the Magi≈øtrate; or ≈øome appointed univer≈øality and ab≈øolute conformity in the≈øe even to unity may be pre≈ø≈øed without ju≈øt ≈øcruple of con≈øcience.</p>
                  <p>For to ≈øpeak once for all, to make acts of common rea≈øon, intendment, and benefit for particular places by them in ≈øupremacy of power, becau≈øe by them asked, and not by others, is exceeding ≈øelfi≈øh, which who ever hath purcha≈øed out a particular act can ea≈øily re≈øent.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is ju≈øtly de≈øired ≈øuch things to be generally the ≈øame; For prohibiting of new Inns, Taverns, &amp;c. and ou≈øting tho≈øe erected within ≈øeven or ten years, unle≈øs allowed by your Commi≈ø≈øioners, and upon due and ≈øet cau≈øe to di≈øable the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and allow others, or fine to ≈øome purpo≈øe, as receiving any to tipple on the Lords Day, or dayes of publike either prayer or humiliation.</p>
                  <p>And that all things may hold a proportion, that all Offices Honorary, fiduciary, or profitable be ≈øo di≈øtributed, that the work intended may be done, or the neglecters puni≈øhed; and that ≈øuch as are faithful, may know certainly to whom to make their addre≈ø≈øes; for many errors are ≈øeen and felt, and the State is ≈øen≈øible of them in part, as by the careful Orders i≈ø≈øued out from the Right Honorable the Councel of State appears.</p>
                  <p>But how to execute them, and not be caught in the witty ≈øpringes of our pre≈øent Cabali≈øtical Law, no Ju≈øtice of Peace can determine; and generally the more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and able, the more wary, at lea≈øt in opening of the fruitle≈øs, or rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructively fruitful niceties pa≈øt, whereby the many are cooled to action.</p>
                  <p>For if they apprehend men dangerous, That live high, and yet can give no account how they come by it; what ≈øhould they do? To impri≈øon for no cau≈øe vi≈øible, is hard to ≈øome; not to do it, de≈øtructive with others; to pri≈øon in the Gaole, charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and the place having no labor to bu≈øie body or mind, fatall; in <hi>Bridewell,</hi> ≈øhameful; and generally work they will not, and all this from the want of due Law.</p>
                  <p>Next, our Lawyers are eminently favourers of nicety of Law, and open it to the ruine of publick ≈øafety; for from an opinion that Lead is parcel of the free-hold of the Church, to rob all Churches ≈øo called, is ≈øo frequent, that it is feared they will ≈øoon come to pull down hou≈øes: No, ≈øaith the Learned, ≈øue him, and he hath nought to recompence the ≈øame; ≈øo there mu≈øt be vi≈øible actuall force with Guns, &amp;c. to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence a forcible detainer, or the indictment lies not, whereby po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions are kept oft times ten years together, many ≈øeven; ≈øue they dare not, the Law is ≈øo nice, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious and chargeable; this is de≈øtroying property in hone≈øt <hi>Engli≈øh;</hi> for cutting up young Timber, felling young ≈øtands, underwood, and the like, with many other wrongs, no law, no remedy evident or practi≈øed.</p>
                  <p>Alter but the Law of hanging for Felony, and this and a thou≈øand things will the learned make Felony ≈øtreight, if you give but two-fold re≈øtitution or ≈øervitude for a ≈øet time to be by you appointed.</p>
                  <p>But e≈øpecially look to give ≈øpeedier Law in the proper places, to at lea≈øt the poor,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:105181:55"/> or ≈ømall matters; it is nece≈ø≈øary to Commi≈ø≈øionate ≈øome for the ≈øpeciall Counties, and that to determine all ≈øuits both in Law and equity; the want of this is the main root of growing poverty; and that upon Petition, without formalities of Bill, and An≈øwer, Declaration and Plea; give a ≈øtop to cur≈øory Writes of Error, and regulate executions; for under Sheriffs and their Officers have need of it, if any.</p>
                  <p>I love the Rea≈øon of our Laws, and am as much again≈øt Tyranny, or pure Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government, as any man; I honor the learned and upright Lawyer, and would have vertue, learning, yea and ≈øervice in all due Offices ≈øhould be regarded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded; I allow the nece≈ø≈øary dependances of inferiours in all ranks upon the ≈øupream or ab≈øolute powers re≈øpectively; it is but the unnece≈ø≈øary, fruitle≈øs, or de≈øtructive intere≈øts that are oppo≈øed, which every ju≈øt man will ≈øtand for both with life and e≈øtate.</p>
                  <p>And by you, Right Honorable, in your pro≈øecutions thereof, let no private re≈øpect take you off; it is not only rea≈øon, but nece≈ø≈øity calls to you for it; therefore on in the excellency of ≈øtrength; fear not a cla≈øh with any corrupt intere≈øts what≈øoever; onely what is ju≈øt, let it be done ju≈øtly; it is the eminencie of Vertue alone can make your enemies hearts yours, though power may conquer their per≈øons.</p>
                  <p>By this time it is time to winde up my Clue of Hi≈øtory, wherein I profe≈øs in the pre≈øence of God, I have to the utmo≈øt of my skill and knowledge, waved all bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and what ever might ju≈øtly give occa≈øion of offence.</p>
                  <p>I yet know ≈øome will be taken by men of all tempers; I, nor no man that will ≈øpeak truths in ≈øuch a ≈øea≈øon of intere≈øts, can expect to plea≈øe all, if it be hardly po≈ø≈øible at any time; I ≈øhall as God ≈øhall enable me, go on (the a≈øsi≈øtance of who≈øe gracious Spirit I humbly crave) and hold forth what the Law of pure rea≈øon, agreeable to the divine word hath e≈øtabli≈øhed to be the Rule for the exerci≈øe of Ju≈øtice and of Righteou≈øne≈øs among Chri≈øtians.</p>
                  <p>But ≈øome will expect, that I ≈øhould ≈øpeak one word to our ≈øo much pleaded boundaries to Preregative and Rule of Priviledge, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> ≈øo called, and the Petition of Right, more then what hath been ≈øaid. I ≈øuppo≈øe needle≈øs to ≈øhew that they re≈øpectively in their ≈øea≈øons were but the beginnings of that freedome which the Subjects of tho≈øe times breathed after; they are to us, or were before the≈øe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions brake out, but the reducing, as I may ≈øay, of ≈øpeculative or notional Liberty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a way of practicall or real Freedome; for what was before only in the brea≈øt of the Judge, was now in Engli≈øh letters made obvious to each mans ≈øen≈øe, ≈øo that they after pleaded that Letter again≈øt any contrary walkings, whether in the King or his Officers.</p>
                  <p>So that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is not pleaded as the utmo≈øt due of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Subject, nor the Petition of Right, but as tho≈øe things which are ≈øo e≈ø≈øentiall in the generalty to any Nation, that even the Kings mu≈øt afford them, or they are not ju≈øt.</p>
                  <p>And the Rulers mu≈øt act accordingly, or they are betrayers of Tru≈øt.</p>
                  <p>And if it be impartially di≈øcu≈ø≈øed, it will appear that the private intere≈øt of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or the power intru≈øted for publick benefit abu≈øed for ≈øelf-ends, hath been the ground of the principal oppo≈øition to Prices; for where hath the exce≈øs of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or ≈øtretching the Law for publick benefit, or honor of the Nation, or again≈øt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick vi≈øible offendors been impugned? no, the lives of many Citizens, and the confi≈øca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their e≈øtates, not to ≈øpeak of taxes, or re≈øtraint of Liberty, have been by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralty prai≈øed and allowed, though ≈øome prudent one might Stoically out of the fore-≈øight of mi≈ø-improving the≈øe pre≈øidents by evill men di≈øallow ≈øuch Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                  <p>If a free-≈øpirited under≈øtanding Engli≈øhman look upon the fir≈øt Chapter of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> unle≈øs enforced through nece≈øsity to make u≈øe of any ≈øhaft to wound an Adver≈øary, yea, though it flyes in his own face and wounds him, what will he ≈øay to it? for after the freedome granted to the ≈øo called Church, the Preface or A≈ø≈øumption on the Kings part, is, That he having God before his eyes, for the ≈øalvation of his own ≈øoul, and the ≈øouls of his Predece≈ø≈øors and Succe≈ø≈øors, of his own free will did give and grant, &amp;c. the Liberties following to be holden of him, his Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øors, &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:105181:55"/>
                  <p>And the≈øe Liberties are there called Franchi≈øes, which intimates the Kings gave them the freedoms there ≈øet down now, who before had none; and let any unintere≈øted man look upon them, and he will ≈øee they indeed hold a rea≈øon of policy, but ≈øtill ≈øub≈øervient to the fir≈øt ≈øettlement of the Ba≈øtard <hi>William;</hi> there are many notable ju≈øt things in it; and ≈øurely ≈øuch as by which the people were judged before the Charter granted; but the people not having ought a≈ø≈øured, and before the power of the King, the intere≈øt of Nobles, the corruption of Iudges, other matters rendring the Law then wholly incertain, they ≈øought this to clear up and a≈ø≈øure their right, as far as might be; for Iu≈øtice ought to be like as the Elements are by the fir≈øt intention, wholly free.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the true under≈øtanding wi≈øe man ≈øaith, That he inforces not <hi>Magna Charta</hi> as the boundary to <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Laws, or ju≈øt Freedom, or Chri≈øtian Liberty, but as a Catalogue of ≈øuch immunities as were granted by the Kings to the Subjects formerly, according to the then light the Nation had to ask, and power to inforce; for ≈øo they were pleaded by the Grantor, many of which are now wholly cea≈øed by time, others have been altered, ≈øome enlarged by ≈øub≈øequent judgements ≈øo called, and Statutes; and it is evident, that the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> now long and thir≈øt after a rational ≈øetled Law in all the parts in the whole body, taking the Law of God for the Rule, as the Charter-Grantor did, though the face of man was the vi≈øible Engine to draw the plea≈øant ≈øtreams of Liberty out of the Ocean of Royal Power; and although that ≈øucceeding Princes did never keep the Law wholly, yet it was alwayes evident, that a noble Prince that ≈øought not him≈øelf ≈øo much as the glory of the Nation, the Acts of ≈øuch a one were ≈øeldom, if at all que≈øtioned: So that to give ≈øatisfaction according to the deep and often reiterated Engagements of the Nation, it is requi≈øite that ≈øome ≈øele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, impartial, hone≈øt, under≈øtanding, Religious Patriots be ≈øet apart as a Committee wholly to attend the collecting of a body of Law, out of all Laws, making Gods Word at lea≈øt generally, or the Moral Judicial, that is, that which in point of Rea≈øon is equal and ju≈øt to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> or <hi>Egyptian</hi> as to the <hi>Jew,</hi> to whom yet an <hi>Hebrew</hi> was an abomination; Now it is worthy ≈øerious con≈øideration who to imploy in this work; to imploy Lawyers, is to give no ≈øatisfaction to the people, jealous of the≈øe men who≈øe intere≈øt depends ≈øo ≈øpecially thereon; not to u≈øe them, is to ≈øtir up the prime men of parts, and of va≈øt revenues to a conte≈øt of great importance, and ≈øome think not of evident nece≈ø≈øity; for there are many wi≈øe, ju≈øt, and outwardly religious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt them; out of <hi>Englands</hi> Law-Books its de≈øired it ≈øhould come, the head Rule of Gods Word, and Truth pre≈øerved ≈øtill in the eminency of Power, and then let the Rule of ju≈øt and good be by ≈øuch of them as you ≈øhall appoint, and ≈øuch others as you ≈øhall chu≈øe to commi≈ø≈øionate with them, drawn out of tho≈øe deep fountains of Wi≈ødom (then which none are more excellent generally, nor more divinely rational) and laid open to the view of each one to judge.</p>
                  <p>I ≈øhal give you but one example; we all agree that the civil Law here raigned original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by it the next of kin, whether of fathers ≈øide or mothers to whom the inheritance did by Law de≈øcend, was Guardian of the Infant. The Law of <hi>England</hi> now is, the next of kin to whom the inheritance cannot di≈øcend, is Guardian; the rea≈øon of the Civil Law was, becau≈øe alliance of bloud was the bond of Love, and who would take greater care? but this Law of Nature was found to be mo≈øt unnatural; many (by accidental pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, being corrupted for pride, covetize or envy ≈øake) brake the bonds of Nature; and, for the inheritance ≈øake became the murderers, or in≈øtrumental to the murder, death or captivity of ≈øuch infants, thereby to keep the e≈øtate for ever, or gain to them≈øelves the e≈øtate and inheritance, ≈øaying, this is the heir, let us kill him, and the Inheritance ≈øhall be ours; ≈øo that it is evident, Supremacy of Rea≈øon bare ≈øway, but the rea≈øon is founded upon the divine Rule; but look at other ca≈øes, which are divers, and the rea≈øon divers, and yet all hold force in Law, and that for good rea≈øon ≈øake.</p>
                  <p>As fir≈øt, The Law gives in ≈øome, and mo≈øt places, all the Land to the elde≈øt; and the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe he is thereby enabled to give greater a≈ø≈øi≈øtance to the King in his wars with hor≈øe of ≈øervice, as <hi>William</hi> the Ba≈øtard plotted.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Kent,</hi> there the land is divi≈øible equally among all, becau≈øe all ≈øtand in equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the father: and where the Cu≈øtome is, its Law at this day.</p>
                  <p>A third rule is <hi>Borough Engli≈øh;</hi> there the younger ≈øon had all the Land, as lea≈øt able
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105181:56"/> to maintain him≈øelf; there were no great evils found in the≈øe, &amp; therefore the≈øe all ≈øtand; but its believed by mo≈øt, that were a double portion given to the elde≈øt and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, it might be the ground of a better ≈øettlement then this Nation ever had, who it is agreed did never yet ≈øubmit to that Law. It cannot be denied, but that it will take off much from the va≈øtne≈øs of e≈øtate, which is now ofttimes for many generations conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the ≈øtock of noble Ance≈øtors; but tis an≈øwered, That it will keep from the Gallows, and other places as infamous and more mi≈øerable, many noble and gallant Sprouts and Syences of Royal ≈øtocks, who (having (as it oft falls out) more active and ingenious ≈øpirits then the Elder brother, and) brought up by the indulgent Parent, according to the rank and quality of his father, he dead, and either none, or a ≈ømall portion no way equal to his breeding, but infinitely ≈øhort of his birth, as he calls it, or of his ≈øpirit left him, he being before fired with ambition, is now madded with envy, and in a kinde of de≈øperation, puts him≈øelf upon loo≈øene≈øs and villanies to ≈øupport his indigency.</p>
                  <p>This Law hath therefore much need to be ≈øeriou≈øly con≈øidered, as al≈øo that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing E≈øtate in Tayl and Feoffments upon condition.</p>
                  <p>Tis ageed, none will be more able then the religious Lawyer in this part; but as to the ≈øetling of Courts, Fines, Officers Fees, Times of Trial, Proce≈øs, Execution, and the like, its conceived wholly unfit to have Judge or Lawyer impowred, if holding places of profit actually, or pacti≈øing in any Court under a Fee; for the Nation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains not ≈øo much of the Law of property and right and wrong, as in the di≈øcipline or execution of the Law; its found to be corrupt intere≈øt that troubles both Church ≈øo called and Commonwealth; therefore in this let Lawyers object, but others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, and that according to a Rule of righteou≈øne≈øs, namely for Ju≈øtice ≈øake, not to maintain intere≈øt, as hitherto the puny Clerks and unfavored Lawyer, and young Attorny, and heretofore ≈øome puny Iudges would be content with Reformation, for they could not be wor≈øed by the bargain; No, tis tho≈øe Officers that have places from four or five hundred, to ten or twenty thou≈øand <hi>per annum,</hi> that are loth to be drawn to the Standard of Iu≈øtice: Tis this and the like ca≈øts odiums upon ju≈øt things under the name of Levelling, de≈øtroyers of property, de≈øpi≈øers of Governments, haters of Order, projectors for Anarchy, enemies to <hi>Cae≈øar,</hi> that is, the Supream Magi≈øtrate; we have ≈øeen, and mo≈øt do believe, that many no way affecting Reformation, have held forth ju≈øt things only to deceive and delude, and lull the State a≈øleep, untill they were fit for their de≈øign. But the≈øe al≈øo admire that the State do not the≈øe ju≈øt things, to take away the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of ≈øuch mens a≈øper≈øions, and mutinous clamorous, and hinder others from being drawn into ≈øuch Toyls by too ea≈øie credulity, while they after renewed complaints finde no amendments; they hear and li≈øten day after day, and moneth after moneth, but there's no end of their expectation; God hath changed, and changed, and changed again, but their bondage is they ≈øay the ≈øame.</p>
                  <p>Tis mo≈øt true, tis not po≈ø≈øible to plea≈øe every pallat, e≈øpecially when each pallat hath mo≈øt vi≈øibly a di≈øgu≈øt; we are faln into many pieces; God hath taken us, and da≈øhed us one again≈øt another; yea now the Evil is come to that pa≈øs, that the wound of carnality is mo≈øt evident in the Envyings of Profe≈ø≈øors: O what bitter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity among tho≈øe call them≈øelves the people of God! and though Di≈øcipline be pretended, its evident the root is Government, the high-gate of Preferment, eminency of Power, multitudes of followers, and the like. Brethren, is this of Chri≈øt? Is this according to his Rule? He that will rule, let him be ≈øervant to all.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but apply to ≈øuch heady ones, that of <hi>Fe≈øtus</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> without cau≈øe, to you with cau≈øe; <hi>The knowledge of the world hath beguiled you;</hi> You deceive your ≈øelves and others, while you contemn all men but your ≈øelves; and all judgement that agrees not with your opinions. Where is the Image of God? Look upon the Magi≈øtrate, by what names or titles ≈øo ever di≈øtingui≈øhed, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute not the judgement of God, but of them≈øelves; they rule to ≈øatisfie their lu≈øt; they glory in outward power, riches, honor, and the like; the great men, both tho≈øe that are mighty through wi≈ødom, as the learned Lawyer, Phi≈øitian, Divine; mighty in ≈øtrength, as the Commander in war, Military Power; or the Magi≈øtrate from the highe≈øt Iudge to the lowe≈øt Con≈øtable, who are cloathed with civil power,
<pb facs="tcp:105181:56"/> all as the Supream in Tru≈øt do lead, follow the dance of eying the ≈øplendors and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the world; and can we think that the multitude will not follow?</p>
                  <p>O all you mighty men, What hath made you thus ha≈øte to de≈øtruction? What was it that by degrees made po≈ø≈øible, what confidently none of you could once think on, the executing of a King in the chief City of his Realm? what made you ≈øeek a change? and what prepared the way to the Iudgement which God had appointed? was it not Self-≈øeeking? was it not raigning for Self? was it not Oppre≈ø≈øion in Iu≈øtice? was it not altering the end of the Law, more then the Law it ≈øelf, though that was laid to his charge, as fitte≈øt to draw the people to a ≈øen≈øible intere≈øt?</p>
                  <p>Tho≈øe that came in place after, what was it rendred them obnoxious to change? was it not driving on the ≈øame trade? and mo≈øt a≈ø≈øuredly it will in Gods Jnqui≈øition for righteou≈øne≈øs and Iudgement, ruine all that ≈øhall tread the ≈øame path; you cannot wholly ruine the native Liberty.</p>

                  <p>Fir≈øt, Concerning the Tax for the Army; It hath, as to its great and unju≈øt inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity been long complained of; for ≈øome paid but two pence <hi>per</hi> pound; that is the rate came to two pence <hi>per</hi> pound in tho≈øe parts, and they gave in but half value of their lands, as twenty: True value was rated at ten; and no more, if ≈øo much; and the Towns adjacent were at full value, one ≈øhilling two pence <hi>per</hi> pound: yea, ≈øome in other places one ≈øhilling ten pence; ≈øo that in the highe≈øt rates to the E. of <hi>Manche≈øter, Briti≈øh</hi> Army, <hi>Newark,</hi> the Garri≈øons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the poor owner, and ≈øome rich ones did freely offer their whole Revenues to di≈øcharge Taxes. This burthen was long laboured again≈øt; after this comes an Act for an equal pound rate; this by them who had good bargains was oppo≈øed and delayed; ≈øo that the Armies nece≈ø≈øities enforced a return to the old way of error; Some ju≈øt men renew this work more rigorou≈øly, and an Act comes down for ≈øix months, beginning at 25. of <hi>Decem.</hi> la≈øt; the Act comes ≈øo late that its not po≈øsible to act towards the fir≈øt three moneths; and that there might not be ≈øuch delayes and evils as had faln out upon the former three months, which gave no power to the Commi≈øsioners to act otherwi≈øe then by a pound rate; ≈øo that many feared Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munires; this gave ≈øuch a power in ca≈øe of not being able to compa≈øs the work in due time, to return back again. The bu≈øine≈øs of the ≈øecond three months was not thought fit to be put on foot till the fir≈øt three moneths were ended, when the time comes, the old Oppo≈øers are the new Oppo≈øers, and plead ≈øeveral pleas, which will inlighten much to the truth of what is before Hi≈øtorized. The main objections were three or four; fir≈øt, It was Levelling, and that it was as ju≈øt to reduce all mens e≈øtates to an equality, as the rates after ≈øo long continuance; this a grave and wi≈øe man otherwi≈øe, ≈øtrenuou≈øly a≈ø≈øerted. The ≈øecond was, It was an ob≈øtruction to the ≈øervice of the State; for alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Cu≈øtomary Rates would be long in ≈øettling, &amp; the monies would not come in, and then the Souldier would return to free quarter; and the next, The Garri≈øon of <hi>Lin</hi> were earne≈øt not to alter, fearing, as they ≈øaid, That they that took free-quarter, when it was not due, and more then was due, would out-do Rea≈øon if really behind. The la≈øt was, when we had done what we could, we could not make a truly perfect Rate: There was a fourth, but little to the purpo≈øe; and that was, we knew not what nor how to rate, and ≈øo we might over-rate as well as under-rate, and for that we had no power. To the fir≈øt it was an≈øwered, That a rule of Ju≈øtice was de≈øired, not equalling e≈øtates, but equal rating of them, the be≈øt way to quiet ≈øpirits from thoughts of unju≈øt Levelling. To the ≈øecond, That it ob≈øtructed not the ≈øervice to alter the rates from evil to good; the ≈øouldier ≈øhould have his money, and would but each one lend their helping hand, as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105181:57"/> ≈øoon as in the old way, and to avoid rai≈øing more, they would rai≈øe le≈øs, and then rate a new, as the Act ordered; but if ob≈øtructing Service would bear a rate ab≈øolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to an Act before, that rea≈øon would allow a little over rating now; and the rather becau≈øe it ≈øhould truly ea≈øe the next A≈ø≈øe≈øsment, the Accompter would appear, and no evil done. To the third, it was ≈øaid, That the evil unju≈øt rate had continued ≈øeven years, and no remedy, as unju≈øt as at fir≈øt, and mu≈øt be ≈øo for ever; for the rule was to rate as formerly.</p>
                  <p>This was now provided for, and what was now pleaded, That the Parliament did not intend any alteration, for alteration could not be without ob≈øtruction: Thus Self makes u≈øe of all weapons for her advantage; and were it po≈øsible to tru≈øt men in chief places not ≈øo ≈øelfi≈øh, or that tho≈øe in Supremacy were ≈øo clear that right might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, we ≈øhould ≈øoon ≈øee an alteration.</p>
                  <p>The next thing which I hold my ≈øelf bound to give notice to the Nation of, is, The A≈øsizes for <hi>Norfolk</hi> were according to evil Cu≈øtome, if there be ≈øo much in it, kept at <hi>Thetford</hi> on the brink of the River parting <hi>Norfolk</hi> &amp; <hi>Suffolk;</hi> the u≈øe ari≈øing from the High-Sheriffs heretofore ≈øerving for both Counties, it having no pri≈øon fit to receive the multitude of pri≈øoners in <hi>Norwich</hi> Ca≈øtle, being as <hi>per</hi> Calender 144. The civil part was there only determined, and not the criminal. Now I ≈øhal omit to ≈øpeak of the abundance of forfeitures by this means, though falling much upon the poor, it helps forward the nece≈øsity of Levellers in the gro≈ø≈øe≈øt acceptation, by reducing them to ab≈øolute beggery; I ≈øhall onely ≈øpeak of the triall of the Gaol, which will hint matters of ≈øome concernment. Fir≈øt, there was a Commi≈øsion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer;</hi> next, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øsion of the Peace; The≈øe Commi≈øsions are not ≈øetled by Act of Parliament in the County, but are a part of Prerogative, and grantable at plea≈øure of the Supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øtie. Now there were many Pri≈øoners which were bound over to the next Goal-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery; the≈øe the learned in the Law upon mature deliberation, and after great advi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, re≈øolve they cannot try: con≈øider the rea≈øons which I mu≈øt own Legally, of great weight, but hear them; by the Commi≈øsion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter.</hi> they could not be heard, for the Recognizance was onely at Gaol-delivery, therefore they could not be called by the Commi≈øsion of the Peace; they could not try them, for the Se≈øsions of the Peace had before referred them to the trial of a Superior Judge (of cour≈øe) for difficulty of the matter: but if was agreed that had a Commi≈øsion of Gaol-delivery come, the ≈øame men without a Superior Judge, or more skill or knowledge in the Law then they had before, would have tried them. Is not Form the Idol of the world? I appeal to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream power for the priviledg of the Nation, and be≈øeech them that the due rights of a Free Nation may be e≈øtabli≈øhed in ≈øetled Judicatories in the Nation. Here al≈øo fell out another Quaere at this great Se≈øsions, namely, what to do in ca≈øe of an Under-Sheriff, who ≈øhould execute his Office beyond his year; contrary to the Statute we found this. The High-Sheriff of the County (as u≈øually before, to the great prejudice of the people of the Nation under the late King) did make a bargain with an Attorney, to be, or find one to be for him, ≈øuch a one as he would undertake for his Under-Sheriff. This man contracts with the Kings Sheriff accordingly, and him≈øelf and his ≈øon (a young boy, as the Ju≈øtices upon view judged him of about eighteen years of age) execute the Office, both at the la≈øt A≈øsizes and this Se≈øsions, and the intervals, not having taken any Oath; it was demanded of the boy, who was Under-Sheriff? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered, his father, but his name was u≈øed; he was tried by the Ju≈øtices to read a precept, he could not do it; ≈øo for double di≈øability, he was di≈øallowed by the generalty of the Ju≈øtices; by this practi≈øe if the Father were Under-Sheriff, he lo≈øt two hundred pound by the Statute for this year, and two hundred pound more for a year before; for it is ≈øaid he hath ≈øerved now three years, and I beleeve un≈øworn all the time, if due inquiry were made.</p>
                  <p>Next, the ≈øon forfeits 40. pound for executing without Oath, yea though unfit; but notwith≈øtanding all this, two Ju≈øtices of the Peace pre≈øent at the debate, do the next day ≈øwear this Boy, thereby ≈øure intending to intricate the bu≈øine≈øs, and give the Father leave to plead again≈øt his Forfeiture of 200. pound, or que≈øtion for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting the Office un≈øworn.</p>
                  <p>I ≈øay no more, but I think they de≈øerve a Fine above his, be≈øides forfeiture of their Tru≈øts, and the rather becau≈øe the mans integrity, and ≈øo fitne≈øs for the Office, is as much que≈øtioned as any mans in <hi>Norfolk.</hi> Gent. To ≈øue for this in the Travailes, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øes, Delayes, Tortures of the Law, who will?</p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:105181:57"/>
                  <p>You are the Fathers of the Family, if you plea≈øe to take this notice according to your Tru≈øts who are in the places of Eminency and Supream Power in the Nation, from a ≈øon, a brother, a Citizen of the Commonwealth, do; if not, I have ≈øatisfied my Con≈øcience, the evil lies at your door, if you think as they who have gone before you have done, to ≈øalve all with The Law is open, 'Tis begging the que≈øtion:</p>
                  <p>We ≈øay, the door was never ≈øo fa≈øt ≈øhut as now, either in the ≈øetled Law Courts in Ordinary, or new ones of Committees; for, though the doors be open, that is, there is ea≈øie beginning ≈øuits, that is, it is ea≈øie to complain; yet the journey is great from the remotene≈øs of places; and in Committees 'tis ≈øo difficult to get them together; in the other Courts there is ≈øo much bu≈øine≈øs, that there are ≈øo many ob≈øtructions to right, e≈øpecially of poor men, or quiet ≈øpirits; and e≈øpecially, the men of Law are ≈øo favoured, that there is a dead heart in all men to ≈øeek Reformation. Remedy this, and you will finde complainers enow.</p>
                  <p>But if a great man now be complained of for ju≈øt things, as have been offered to be avowed upon Oath, yet rather then ≈øtand the ≈øhock of a ≈øuit, the wi≈øe mans Councel in <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtes</hi> is the poor mans comfort, <hi>Go not to ≈øuit with him that is too mighty for thee;</hi> compound with him is the way, though he requires all thy ≈øub≈øtance as too little to ≈øatisfie his wronged honour, brought into que≈øtion, ≈øuch a one as he ≈øcandalized, though all his friends know the truth of the ca≈øe, how wi≈øely ≈øoever carried, that is legally, avoiding the reach of the practical (Law ≈øo called.)</p>
                  <p>I know no truly wi≈øe and prudent man de≈øires a mea≈øure exactly ju≈øt, that is, ≈øuch as again≈øt which no objection will lie; no ≈øurely, if there be ≈øuch bad Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, there will be evil men; what is de≈øired, is not only po≈ø≈øible, but fea≈øable, were there but ju≈øt endeavours after it; were not the diver≈øions ≈øo vi≈øible, it were tolerable; but when its well known, that all eyes are upon you, when all engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Artifices which the Religion held forth, or prudence at be≈øt ≈øugge≈øt, have been not only proffered, but penally enforced, what but a ≈øeared con≈øcience will not relent, or a nealed face blu≈øh?</p>
                  <p>Former ≈øervices do not acquit latter offences; the in≈øtances of the elder of the <hi>Horatii, Manlius</hi> and other among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and multitudes of other in other places, evidence.</p>
                  <p>The greate≈øt and mightie≈øt Princes are ≈øubject to the ≈øame proportionable chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with their meane≈øt Subjects; and the Subject hath this advantage, he is be≈øt able to bear it.</p>
                  <p>Our evil hath grown from lenity; our remedy mu≈øt be at lea≈øt nece≈ø≈øary ≈øeverity; and if you be not guilty, you may u≈øe it freely; 'Tis offendors cry out ≈øo ≈øternly for mercy; you are now by true intere≈øt and obligation, to labour a well grounded peace to this; the occa≈øions of publique di≈øgu≈øt mu≈øt be fir≈øt taken away. Remember natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and rational Priviledge, the clearing of intere≈øted Dependancies; take them away, they are vi≈øible and vi≈øibly known.</p>
                  <p>Next, ≈øettle ≈øuch plain and evidently rational Laws and proceedings; as may a≈ø≈øure Ju≈øtice in the end, and that Common and Univer≈øal Ju≈øtice, that as <hi>England</hi> is one, our Law may be one, and that known; this will unite ≈øpirits and affections, whereas plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of parties or intere≈øts nouri≈øhed, they generate and con≈øider advantages, as hath been evident in the traver≈øes of this Nation.</p>
                  <p>You have ≈øeen the ≈øtanding out of the King again≈øt a few ju≈øt things made at la≈øt, that many that would have been granted, would not ≈øerve the turn: I profe≈øs, it is meer zeal to Ju≈øtice<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> hath produced this.</p>
                  <p>I have avoided bitterne≈øs to the utmo≈øt; My only hope, de≈øire and prayer is for the welfare of the Nation, and the e≈øtabli≈øhing of it upon the firm <hi>ba≈øis</hi> of mo≈øt unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable verities; I ≈øhrink under the oppo≈øition Truth is like to find. I know the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Nations come not till Nature as it were almo≈øt ≈øtifled, labors for life, it mu≈øt purge or peri≈øh. I know where knowledge is greate≈øt, Satan is bu≈øie≈øt; here mu≈øt be great, if not the greate≈øt oppo≈øition; what God hath I hope dictated to my ≈øpirit, I have held forth to you of this Nation, who are in ≈øupream Tru≈øt. You know how dangerous a thing it is to alter the frame of Ancient Government; you yet ≈øee its ea≈øier far to pull down then to build; to you I ≈øay, it mu≈øt be extraordinary Ju≈øtice and exemplary vertue mu≈øt ≈øtabli≈øh you.</p>

                  <p>The temper of our old Engli≈øh Government in the mixtures of the three main Regiments was in Chri≈øtian Politicks heretofore held the ≈øounde≈øt of all, mo≈øt ju≈øt, and ≈øo mo≈øt durable: As for evil Government of Kings, through u≈øurpation of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the purity of it being de≈øtroyed, they did admit and do to this E≈øtabli≈øhment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out King or Lords; yet if the contrary drawings of the Democratique e≈øtate, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øatiate intere≈øt, as old Writers have objurgated of many equals, tend to the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of pre≈ø≈øures, either of pur≈øe or per≈øon, the i≈ø≈øue will be dangerous; it's evident the loo≈øer knots have been untied by the halter, I mean the Robber, Burgler, &amp;c. but the treble Cord of the Religious, Nece≈ø≈øitous (poor which are a multitude, joyning with the pretending Leveller) and Hypocritical Oppo≈øer, will know their time, they look for the day of their nece≈ø≈øity: There is nothing of Ju≈øtice or Civil Righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs in a ≈øtrict ≈øurvey more then what meer form produces, or nece≈øsity among the many. If there be not a ≈øpeedy ≈øettlement, there mu≈øt be a di≈ø-≈øettlement; the people are prone to, as well as ≈øtirred up to di≈øobedience; did you command never ≈øo well, if Subjects ≈øhake off the yoak, or loo≈øe it but in what or as long as they plea≈øe, Empire mu≈øt down.</p>
                  <p>We are now as it were in the dregs of ≈øo called Populacy; the Kings attempted alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and alteration was ju≈øt, but ju≈øt things mu≈øt be done ju≈øtly; and as he ≈øuffered for ≈øeeking him≈øelf, ≈øo will others in their day (if the expected one come) mete out to you.</p>
                  <p>You are compa≈ø≈øed about with difficulties every way, God give you eyes to ≈øee your way ≈øtill; we looking at your tran≈øactions afar off, have ≈øeen God going along with you; Be not deceived, you ≈øee it was not in eminency of Ju≈øtice, Righteou≈øne≈øs, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Truth acted, but held forth; no, we ≈øaw your failings, but hope of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity; for we ≈øaw God evidently changing your Errors into a que≈øtion of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øight and prudence to your Enemies, ≈øo that they beleeved that Stratagemicall which was Ca≈øual, or rather of providence.</p>
                  <p>O that all this might but rai≈øe a heart in you to ≈øerve and tru≈øt God; do not only hear Sermons; and for you of other ≈øtations, labour Righteou≈øne≈øs in your places; your divi≈øions ≈øhew your carnality. Learn the nature of the one Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, I≈øaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ratified to us Chri≈øtians ≈øo di≈øtingui≈øhed from time, as of Faith and Works, that as much of Works is now requi≈øite under the Covenant ≈øo called of grace, as was before of Faith under the Covenant of works; contend not ≈øo much, whether Magi≈øtrate or Congregations be the Keeper of the fir≈øt Table, as both to give due glory to God, and educate the people faithfully in the knowledge and practice of the Doctrine of the Go≈øpel; and you chief in power, to ≈øee to govern them according to a Rule of Righteou≈øne≈øs, upon a ≈øure foundation in all places and callings, which according to the Talent God hath given me, I ≈øhall here hold forth to you, and that out of the ≈øo called Law of <hi>England,</hi> or u≈øually accepted Law Books of the ≈øame with the Word of God, and the approved examples of our mo≈øt free Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors, wherein that I name not the Authors, I have before laid down the rea≈øon; I ≈øhall only now hint, That its the duty of Magi≈øtrates not to regard the per≈øon of the man from whom the work comes; grant it but my mite, if it be pure Gold, put it into the Trea≈øury; I will give much light to ≈øome, and though others know much more, let them al≈øo improve their talent; make u≈øe of this till then.</p>
                  <p>Some ≈øay, 'tis the nature of <hi>Engli≈øhmen</hi> better to follow in the dark, then go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the light; give no more occa≈øion to that proverb; I am no enemy to Powers or Authorities. Here is nothing difficult elevated above ordinary frame, ≈øo au≈øtere that the practice is impo≈ø≈øible for a time, or dangerous to many; for it is ≈øalutary to ten times ≈øo many more; It is the reducing Government in as much as may, and the progre≈ø≈øes thereof to the Rule of our Saviour, My yoak is ea≈øie, and my burthen light, laying forth Ju≈øtice in a due proportion betwixt the Duty and the Power; ≈øo opening the rea≈øon of the Magi≈øtrates power, and the Subjects obedience, that the ancient Quarrels of Intere≈øts on either ≈øide, mu≈øt be little, if any at all, ≈øtinting the many mutterings and murmurings again≈øt the State from the default of Officers and Clerks, not of the Judges them≈øelves, which if not done, do all the good you can, and you will be ≈øtill a≈øper≈øed and ≈øcandalized, and there is ≈øome rea≈øon; for they and their Clerks are alike; for their care is neither for publike good, nor common hone≈øty; all they look at, is private gain, the great di≈øhonour of a State and Nation.</p>

If ≈øo, to them ≈øay ≈øo, I am ≈øilent.

                     <head>The fir≈øt Quaere, what is Monarchy and its Divi≈øions?</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Ir≈øt, Monarchy in General, or ab≈øolute Monarchy, is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of one man according to his own Will, without any regulation. So whether he rules ju≈øtly, or inju≈øtly, hath ≈øeemed needle≈øs to quaere, ≈øuppo≈øing that the people having ≈øimply ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, what ever he doth is ju≈øt, though ju≈øt rea≈øon with ju≈øt men be his Rule.</p>
                     <p>But here is to be quaeried, whether ≈øuch ab≈øolute ≈øubjection binde the parties ≈øo ≈øubjecting them≈øelves to obedience in things unlawful and evidently de≈øtructive to publike good.</p>
                     <p>To this it is Summarily an≈øwered, that they them≈øelves are not bound; for as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth nothing in vain, ≈øo neither communities of men, who act together by pure Naturals, that is, look at what they call good, therefore as for pre≈øervation of the whole, they agree to be ≈øubject, who were free; ≈øo for the ≈øame rea≈øon vi≈øible, they may rea≈ø≈øume that ≈øubjection into native freedom; and this the examples of all Ages, Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> manife≈øt to be the Law of pure Rea≈øon, whether their attemps were ≈øucce≈øsful or no.</p>
                     <p>But what if bound by an Oath?</p>
                     <p>To this I ≈øay, the Oath mu≈øt and can work no otherwi≈øe (intentionally) if free, then to the general end afore≈øaid, common ≈øafety, and that de≈øtroyed, they are loo≈øed; for the Law of Nature, and for Freedom ≈øake, all rea≈øon annexes, and mu≈øt annex ≈øuch a condition to every ≈øuch Oath.</p>
                     <p>But what if the Oath were enforced?</p>
                     <p>I ≈øay, it is ab≈øolutely and ≈øimply void; all Laws in all Nations in pecuniary contracts, the <hi>Minima hominis,</hi> damn enforced Oathes, then much more in main matters of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though the intere≈øt of Princes and great men, under colourable ≈øhews and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions of peace, and quiet thereby, have cau≈øed great Wits, and great Pens to abandon Nations to the lu≈øts of particular men.</p>
                     <p>This cleared in the ab≈øolute Magi≈øtrate, it will be more then clear in the limited, that cautioned Freedom, how ever obtained, and by whom, ever mu≈øt be ob≈øerved; and though that the be≈øt ordet is a whole Repre≈øentative to act in enforcing and judging matters of ≈øo high concernment;</p>
                     <p>Yet the declarative act of breach of Tru≈øt pa≈øt by the major part, execution as with us may be ju≈øt; though ≈øome ≈øay not ju≈øtly done, (that is, in manner and form, I here admit of Form:) But ≈øome ≈øay, it had in the formal part ample ≈øatisfaction, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the letter of the Law, and ≈øo was done ju≈øtly; for if a force were upon the hou≈øe, it was by the hou≈øe; and they not que≈øtionable, but either by the whole people, or a new Repre≈øentative; and this till recalled by a more lawful power, mu≈øt be ju≈øt; This was done by Parliament at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> the place, and a ≈øufficient number of per≈øons to make a Court in Law there was; and the Law gives no power to inferiors
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105181:68"/> to take notice of the jangles of equals, e≈øpecially in Supremacy of Power; this in Law, in Con≈øcience they mu≈øt look to them≈øelves, who did the Act; if unju≈øt, our con≈øcience is to look to the pre≈øervation of ju≈øt liberties which we have; and in a due way to gain tho≈øe which under pretence of Conque≈øt, pa≈øt, or pre≈øent, have been gained from us, and by time u≈øurped, which the≈øe men have promi≈øed who are our Repre≈øentatives, that is of the whole Kingdom; for their general and great Engagement is,</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, to do the Nation Right, next to ≈øerve the particular places faithfully for which they are cho≈øen, and to ≈øee they have no wrong;</p>
                     <p>Now of the≈øe Monarchies; ≈øome are Elective, ≈øome Hereditary; this alters not the Cau≈øe, but may make men more cautions, in ca≈øe of the Nation, who≈øe Kingdom is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtituted by Hereditary ≈øucce≈ø≈øion.</p>
                     <p>For if ≈øtrict Order be not held with tho≈øe Kings, they at la≈øt devolve into Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies, that is not onely (one) to Rule, but his Rule to be without any Rule not according to the Law of Righteou≈øne≈øs, but at Lu≈øt, and then there is no way but alteration of the frame of Government in Supremacy.</p>

                     <p>WHere there is equality, and the greate≈øt number Rule, that is called ≈øimple Democracie, which ever was a dangerous State, as newly drawn out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion.</p>
                     <p>The next is where is the whole body thoo≈øe never ≈øo vile a wretch, he is fit for the place, a Tribune of the people, and his Yea, or No goes as far as Any's.</p>
                     <p>An other Democracie is ≈øetled in ≈øeveral choices, refining the gro≈ø≈øer pars by degrees, and by wi≈øe limitations, re≈øtraining the way of confu≈øed meetings, and yet giving ju≈øt freedoms, and to keep Ju≈øtice pure, limiting the Electors as well as the Elected, and that not onely by re≈øtraints of not ≈øuch e≈øtate, or no Vagabond, or that hath been ≈øuch, no Thief, no out-lawed per≈øon, no perjured per≈øon, no ≈øervant; but ≈øome have Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly added, ca≈øt out of the Church, a common Swearer, Lyer, Tavern-haunter, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaner of the Lords Day, a Game≈øter.</p>

                     <p>This yet being the work of the Supream Magi≈øtrate, the more warily ordered the State is in rea≈øon con≈øtituted, the more durable.</p>
                     <p>By this it is plain, that all ≈øubjection was admitted for protection; and that prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction merits, and may require ≈øubjection, and ≈øubjection protection; that this power imployed again≈øt the end, is in Law (that is the radiance or glymp≈øe of Divine Rea≈øon in man) utterly void, and all of them intend but the ≈øame thing, namely publike good, although they ≈øeek it divers wayes.</p>

                     <head>5. What form of Politie is be≈øt?</head>
                     <p>THis pa≈øt, I now come to to quaere, which of the≈øe forms of Politie is the be≈øt? Wherein I cannot be of opinion, that <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> onely out of affection to his Pupil, rai≈øed Monarchy to the top of Excellency; for why ≈øhould he not as well have ≈øet his King above the Laws? but this indeed he did not, re≈øting in a limited Monarchy, wherein the Law was the Kings boundary; and ≈øurely he knew no King limited but in <hi>Greece,</hi> ≈øpecially in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> where I take it, he was ≈øubject to the Ephori, and by them to the Ax, and the Halter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I find the excellency of a Kingdom above a Commonwealth, rather by not having the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105181:68"/> Evils of Ambition and quarrels for Supremacy, then the good of Common Ju≈øtice, Right Laws, and gallant Spirits, begotten and educated.</p>
                     <p>Tis agreed, a King is more ea≈øie to be corrupted, as is, and hath been ever manife≈øted in all ages; and though it was then preferred as more ea≈øie to reduce (for few would then ≈øtand again≈øt publick intere≈øts) yet now it being made the Idol of vain men, and the Chri≈øtian world wholly o're run with vanity, it is harde≈øt to be reclaimed; for things are evidenced to be ea≈øie or difficult, as intere≈øts are.</p>
                     <p>Yet Divine Providence hath here blown upon all intere≈øts, for they were corrupt: (Oh you that are in power, build not with ≈øuch hay and ≈øtubble ≈øtill, for ≈øurely your work is like to pa≈øs the fire.)</p>
                     <p>But a≈ø≈øuredly a Kingdom Hereditary, is far before any other Kingly Government, where the Nation is ≈ømall, bounds large, and ≈øpirits content; for Peace is mo≈øt durable in that Government. And that will give Riches, and the people ≈øhall have ea≈øe and plenty, and grow numerous, (<hi>for emulation the mother of di≈øcord, is re≈øtrained at lea≈øt.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>But then the land will be too ≈øcant, and that Nation mu≈øt fall upon others, or break within her ≈øelf, <hi>or tran≈ømit Colonies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Democracie</hi> mu≈øt be in War abroad, or el≈øe ≈øhe breeds Feavers in her own bowels.</p>
                     <p>Yet <hi>Ari≈øtocracie</hi> and <hi>Oligarchy</hi> ≈øeems wor≈øe, as partaking in more ≈øelfi≈øh intere≈øts; but a≈ø≈øuredly in all, they are be≈øt or wor≈øt, as the men Ruling are.</p>

                     <head>8. Whether better to have general, or particular Laws?</head>
                     <p>I Now mu≈øt come to the hard task of all Polititians, That is, to ≈øet the <hi>Medium</hi> of power in Magi≈øtrates, wherein it is plain, that to tye a Magi≈øtrate (in any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ≈øupreme or inferior, yet admini≈øtring Ju≈øtice to the very ≈øtrict letter of the Law, is to have all the ≈øafety of the Commonwealth ≈øhipt in a Ve≈ø≈øel without ≈øails or oars; ≈ølip but the letter, and no Magi≈øtrate can meddle.</p>
                     <p>Therefore generals mu≈øt be the way, but limited they mu≈øt be, or el≈øe your venture is as much on the other ≈øide; for to give him no bound, or too much, is to put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ve≈ø≈øel overladen, and the ≈øail too full, which upon every gu≈øt is ready to ≈øink, or be o're turned, or run under water.</p>
                     <p>Now to pa≈øs this <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis,</hi> is the hard work in the fir≈øt ≈øettlement: That the ≈øupreme Magi≈øtrate hath his due boundary, and after for him ≈øo to di≈øpence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Magi≈øtrates, that the equal Temperament in every part may a≈ø≈øure the ≈øafety of the whole.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>England,</hi> before the late fatal infu≈øions into King <hi>Charls</hi> his head, of the ab≈øolute po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer due to Princes <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> whereby they were rendred accountable only to God, boa≈øted again≈øt all other Nations of the happine≈øs of all the≈øe Governments, in a ≈øweet and admirable admixture of power; for they had the freedom of a Commonwealth, the opulency of Ari≈øtocracie, the glory of a King.</p>
                     <p>Yet he ≈øo bounded by the Laws, and ≈øo watched by the Emulators of his glory, the Nobles, and by the Con≈øervators of our Liberties, the Commons, that it was hard for him to break.</p>
                     <p>Yet break he did, and that ≈øo ≈øuddenly, that it was evident the ≈øettlement we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in, was but as we ≈øay, <hi>A la≈øt ga≈øp to the decaying ≈øtate of the Ba≈øtard</hi> William, <hi>≈øo called, the Conqueror.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now is the time for them to whom God gives the Honor of a Settlement, ≈øo to mould and temper Government, that it may be mo≈øt durable, which is the glory of a State.</p>
                     <p>Now to do this aright, after the A≈ø≈øurance that nothing be done, how politick or advantageous ≈øoever it ≈øeems, contrary to the light of Chri≈øtian Doctrine, I come to the difficulty above≈øaid, that is, <hi>What Power is to be committed to the Magi≈øtrate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Supreme or Inferior, re≈øpectively?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which I an≈øwer generally, That the Magi≈øtrate, whoever he be that is intru≈øted, ought to have more power then its commonly requi≈øite he ≈øhould improve, that thereby by acts of Grace he may endear or ≈øuppre≈øs, as occa≈øion ≈øhall offer:</p>
                     <p>The Supreme thereby obliging all parties, as well inferior Magi≈øtrates, as other Subjects: the inferior Magi≈øtrate to engage the equals (in all but Magi≈øtracie) and all the vulgar, and that without puni≈øhment from above, or ≈øcorn below.</p>
                     <p>For it is evident there are ever ambitious or in≈øolent Spirits, who if the Magi≈øtrate be tyed too ≈øtreight, will draw him to the end of his line, and then dare him; I wi≈øh from my ≈øoul Magi≈øtrates were all wi≈øe and ju≈øt, fearing God, and hating Covetize; but in the choyce of the≈øe men for intere≈øts, it will not be ≈øo; therefore I meddle not to pre≈øcribe rules, as ≈øome do, for a man who prefers private intere≈øts, but him that onely and principally fixes him≈øelf, and his endeavors upon the advance of Publick and Common good; therefore to them I addre≈øs my ≈øelf, with this Caution;</p>
                     <p>That the great ruining danger, is, in times of Commotion to be over ≈øtrict, beyond late pre≈øidents, and Examples; for that blows the coals of Sedition, yea ≈øparks to a great flame e≈øpecially if publick ruins build private fortunes, ≈øo called, or partake with any ≈øelfi≈øh intere≈øt.</p>
                     <p>They therefore that are in Supream tru≈øts, and would ≈øettle, or continue their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments quiet, mu≈øt them≈øelves in their places, and whom they impower re≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, with (not onely faithfulne≈øs and diligence, but al≈øo) wi≈ødom and di≈øcreet activity, moderate that power which may be lawful, much more that which is exorbitant, or but to be u≈øed again≈øt per≈øons exorbitant (that is, violent Rebellious (and that in acts) di≈øturbers of the Peace) for again≈øt ≈øuch, to ≈øpare one guilty, is to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:105181:69"/> venture the de≈øtruction of a thou≈øand of innocents; <hi>In evident ju≈øt things ≈øettle the power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now I come to the Rules of bounding the inferior Magi≈øtrate, wherein I conceive it is principally requi≈øite to add to the general Rules of Law, or head Laws, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Officers, by which onely it is lawful to act in time of peace, or not imminent danger.</p>
                     <p>That to this Officer being ≈øworn, or tyed under a ≈øet penalty of faithfulne≈øs in his Office, the Magi≈øtrate ≈øend his Warrant, expre≈ø≈øing the cau≈øe of the Warrant, as now to Con≈øtables; and that this Warrant di≈øcharges the Officer, and then the complaint is and ought to be again≈øt the Magi≈øtrate.</p>
                     <p>For no rea≈øon one ≈øhould be puni≈øhed for executing his Office by command of his Superior.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it fit the Magi≈øtrate ≈øhould be too ≈øuddenly lyable to Que≈øtion; therefore it is requi≈øite to have ≈øome appointed near hand, to whom the Magi≈øtrate in Ordinary, and al≈øo the Subject may have recour≈øe, who knowing the Law, may ≈øpeedily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; for otherwi≈øe the Judge or Magi≈øtrate is di≈øcouraged on the one ≈øide to act, and the Subject on the other ≈øide fears his liberty to be infringed, both which mu≈øt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided again≈øt ≈øpeedily and certainly.</p>
                     <p>For it is a≈ø≈øuredly meet, That every one not acting Legi≈ølatively, but judicially upon Laws ≈øet, ≈øhould be under the juri≈ødiction and Cognizance of ≈øome one or more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon or per≈øons, and to make returns to them of at lea≈øt all matters doubtful.</p>
                     <p>And again, That they that act Legi≈ølatively ≈øhould not act judicially, nor be the ≈øame per≈øons, (unle≈øs in ca≈øe of vi≈øible nece≈ø≈øity) lea≈øt otherwi≈øe Ju≈øtice fail.</p>
                     <p>As for example, if the Judges of the Common Bench, Common Pleas, and Chequer were Judges in Parliament, could we think the Parliament fit to determine their Errors; lets have the be≈øt Laws that could be, Laws would be but dead letters ≈øtill in them≈øelves.</p>

                  <div n="9" type="chapter">
                     <head>9. Whether the Laws ought to be according to the Judicial, or what? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a head rule, or not?</head>
                     <p>I Come now to that great and old (difference, or) difficulty, what is the boundary to humane Power, or Authority, or Dominion, call it what you will, it is the executive vertue in the Magi≈øtrate Supream, in dictating, or giving forth of Laws.</p>
                     <p>Now I in this ≈øhall wave treating of Law, in its variety of objects, and ≈øhortly give you this de≈øcription of it.</p>
                     <p>It is the Rule of well ordering Societies of men, or many Families of men living to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and aims e≈øpecially at pre≈øerving the poor and weak, again≈øt the rich and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it is truth, that many Nations have divers Laws, yea, great variety, and all ju≈øt; and ≈øome Nations have a few Laws, and many unju≈øt; naturally, each one ≈øeeks particular good.</p>
                     <p>But as this grew obnoxious to particular per≈øons or families, they joyned together, and that under agreements, wherein there being ≈øtill particular re≈øpects according to the advantages and di≈øadvantages of the Covenanters, ≈øo were the Laws more or le≈øs unju≈øt; but ofttimes that which was ≈øeen unju≈øt after, was not di≈øcovered ≈øuch at the time of enacting.</p>
                     <p>Hence ≈øome have, to take away all wrangles, fallen upon a Community; ≈øome from Community, to Property, ≈øtill looking to avoid the pre≈øent evil; yea from hence indeed ≈øpring all the Commotions, and hurries of the world, which ≈øo Rent and ≈øhake people and Nations.</p>
                     <p>So that there was nothing ≈øo highly honored, as the enacting good Laws; I take it to be the Original, at lea≈øt one of the chief Originals of the <hi>Heroes,</hi> or <hi>Daemones,</hi> men Deified (≈øo God him≈øelf ≈øtiles Magi≈øtrates, becau≈øe of their Repre≈øentation of him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men) and all the≈øe Law-givers pretended at lea≈øt to receive them from the gods, or the friends of the gods.</p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:105181:70"/>
                     <p>For even to natural men it ≈øeemed ju≈øt, that what wi≈øe men had in≈øtit uted, wi≈øe men might alter.</p>
                     <p>Now if the≈øe Laws were onely ≈øome Prerogatives of the Princes, or Priviledges of great men, which men had ≈øought to u≈øher into the world with ≈øuch pomp, there might have been a ground for ob≈øtruction; but the≈øe which were the Laws of well living, the Laws tending to publick quiet, repo≈øe, riches, &amp; honor, (cu≈øtom of living being equal to, if not above nature) were of nece≈ø≈øity thus brought in, onely by fear of the ≈øuppo≈øed Gods; yea, al≈øo the future Magi≈øtrate was by this (≈øuper≈øtition, call it ≈øo) onely kept in aw, not to break forth into exorbitant affections, or decline action, either not to make the Law like the knife of <hi>Delphos</hi> for all purpo≈øes, or el≈øe for no purpo≈øe.</p>
                     <p>So are men bya≈ø≈øed by private re≈øpects on the one hand, and loving ≈øupremacy of power on the other, that unle≈øs there be ≈øome over-awing decree, ≈øome ≈øetled boundary, beyond which we mu≈øt not pa≈øs, there is no ≈øafety.</p>
                     <p>Now if it be ≈øaid, this is indeed true in the cau≈øe of natural men, but not ≈øo to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians; Grace perfects nature: I agree, it is truth in ≈øome ≈øence, but not in every part; for it is rather true in the future, then any other Ten≈øe; for it works here in the fle≈øh not ≈øo inten≈øively, but more remi≈øly, yea, ≈øometimes the effectual work of grace ≈øeems dead; that this is true, the agreed failings of the Saints evidence.</p>
                     <p>Yea tho≈øe in whom the work of Grace was begun ≈øure enough; as witne≈øs <hi>Davids</hi> Pride, Murther, Adultery, <hi>&amp;c. Samuels</hi> ≈øufferance of his ≈øons, <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and all others before Chri≈øt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter,</hi> the ≈øons of <hi>Zebedee, Paul, Barnabas</hi> and others, under the Go≈øpel.</p>
                     <p>So that it is plain we mu≈øt remember it to be truth in ≈øome ≈øort, which was objected again≈øt <hi>Ari≈øtotles</hi> councelling <hi>Alexander,</hi> (as was pretended) to u≈øe the Greeks as friends, and carry him≈øelf as their Guide and Conductor; but to u≈øe the <hi>Barbarians</hi> (meaning thereby all other Nations) as enemies, and carry him≈øelf towards them as Lord and Ma≈øter.</p>
                     <p>The rea≈øon of their objection was very acute; for ≈øay they, there are many Greeks wicked, and many vertuous <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that if any <hi>Quaere,</hi> whether Laws ≈øhould be diver≈øe in re≈øpect of divers ≈øorts of men, it is ≈øhortly an≈øwered, Laws are to re≈øtrain and puni≈øh onely evil, whether men or actions.</p>
                     <p>This being cleared, the next thing is to come to the more clo≈øe and plain re≈øolving of the que≈øtion, wherein I cannot urge antiquity; for I wave all Authors more then as illu≈øtrative, taking none as Authoritative; the ≈øuperintendency of the Expurgatorian Cla≈ø≈øis abroad in forreign Authors, and our <hi>Licentia,</hi> or <hi>Placet</hi> at home, making them ≈øpeak what they li≈øt, or as they li≈øt who are ma≈øters of the Pre≈øs; for if ≈øo done to ≈øome, why not to all? or who can tel to which? and indeed there is no nece≈ø≈øity of either anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or modern te≈øtimony, the Almighty wi≈ødom having the ≈øame fountain of endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, graces and abilities as in any age, and the ≈øame as plentifully poured out now upon us, however it is improved.</p>
                     <p>This premi≈øed, I then <hi>Quaere,</hi> what law is exi≈øtent among any or all the Nations of the world, like that which is called <hi>Mo≈øes Judicial,</hi> holding forth ≈øuch fit and apt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhments, as are there laid down, carrying with it ≈øuch a vi≈øible rea≈øon for it ≈øelf, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Rule of Proportion?</p>
                     <p>I may ≈øay that the law of <hi>England</hi> did own this as its nece≈ø≈øary pattern (it is ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom denyed) but if any do oppo≈øe, or doubt, let them fir≈øt con≈øider, That no law in <hi>England</hi> was ≈øetled (generally at lea≈øt) until the Pope had come to an obliging power, and that agreed; ≈øure as he aped the Ceremonials, he did engage a conformity in Princes as far as might be to the Judicials.</p>
                     <p>I ≈øhall now ≈øee the onely or main objections again≈øt the Judicials, which may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, I take it, to three chiefly.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, they were given to the Jew.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are not, or cannot all be performed by us; for ≈øome were onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Jew, ≈øome no way fitting this Nation, for they were never received; and there is a nece≈ø≈øity of altering laws as vices encrea≈øe, and grow more Obnoxious; and al≈øo in regard the Judicials them≈øelves are not all ≈øo clear that it can be ≈øaid which are all the Judicials, by rea≈øon of mixtures of Ceremonials with them.</p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:105181:70"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Law of Chri≈øt is a Law of Love, not Revenge, to pray for enemies, do good to them that hate us, turn the other cheek to him ≈øtrikes one, and give the cloke to him takes the coat, and go two miles with him enforces thee to one.</p>
                     <p>God a≈ø≈øi≈øting, we will endeavor to clear the≈øe Heads; and then in con≈øideration of the particular Laws, an≈øwer ≈øome particular Objections, if any be ≈øeen needful.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the fir≈øt, That the≈øe things were immediatly directed by the Almighty wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the <hi>Jew,</hi> it is agreed; But what doth this hold forth? Sure onely this, That the <hi>Jew</hi> was bound by them, God having commanded them to that Nation, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not obedience from the other Nations to whom he had given no command, but that any other Nation might not u≈øe them, it proves not;</p>
                     <p>But rather that tho≈øe Laws, as far as holding forth a rule of Ju≈øtice to them which had no Rule, or a better, where defective, ought by the≈øe Nations to whom they were known, to be e≈øtabli≈øhed, is ≈øure out of controver≈øie, while Legi≈ølators have Ju≈øt and Good for their Rule. To the ≈øecond, That they cannot be all performed by us, Let us ≈øee the hindrances.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, Some being ≈øuppo≈øed onely proper to the <hi>Jew,</hi> if we come to ≈øearch what tho≈øe be which we cannot perform, there appear here vi≈øibly but the Law concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Trials of Adultery, and Virginity; we allow the≈øe ought to be inquired into, and ≈øatisfaction given to the jealous ≈øpirit; but we pre≈øume the ≈øpecial Law binds not; That in ca≈øe of Virginity, being, though natural, yet as it were onely proper to that Nation, and that by ≈øome extraordinary power of Divinity, giving forth Te≈øtimony to his own Law.</p>
                     <p>The other ≈øimply extraordinary, in regard the ≈øame water wrought ≈øo contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; ≈øo that the vertue was evidently not in the water: and if we ≈øhould ≈øearch the depth, the ≈øeeds, though conceived by of the Adulterer, could work no more then of a husband in the ordinary cour≈øe of Nature.</p>
                     <p>There is al≈øo ≈øome particular Laws of two wives, humbling of Handmaides, with ≈øome others.</p>
                     <p>The next ≈øort of Laws are ≈øuch as are ≈øaid hold no proportion with the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the people of this or other Chri≈øtian Nations; and therefore the Nations ≈øetled others, and never received them.</p>
                     <p>To this part I an≈øwer; That if it never received them, there was no trial, whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Nation or not. Next if tried, how doth this indi≈øpo≈øition in Nations generally to the receit of particular Laws appear? ≈øure it is not by way of Antipathy, ≈øo that the Nation fails, dies, or is removed upon receiving of them; truth is, we all agree, Nations may be altered by Laws, as the <hi>Romanes</hi> brought from natural ≈øavagene≈øs to a more moderate temper by <hi>Numa's</hi> Laws; and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> by tho≈øe of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus;</hi> and they may be heightned and deba≈øed in ≈øpirit, as well as moderated; but all this re≈øts not in the Law, but the executive part or power of it.</p>
                     <p>Now that force will naturalize Laws, it is plain; why then not Rea≈øon? It is evident, Laws are the reins of Rea≈øon over the bea≈øtial part of man; therefore now to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable man any ju≈øt Law is approveable; as to his obedience, he is a Law to him≈øelf, and happily gives far le≈øs liberty to his particular bea≈øt, his appetite, be it to, or in what it will, then it is fit the general Law ≈øhould hold forth; and this hath ju≈øt wi≈ødom in it; hereby are the good and wi≈øe di≈øtingui≈øhed from the vain and idle, even by the ≈øubjection of natural appetite: from whence it is hereby clear, that to govern a fierce Nation, the ≈øame Laws will not ≈øerve, as to govern a quiet peaceable one.</p>
                     <p>But now our Quaere mu≈øt be, whether there be not be a ju≈øt Law in the generality, agreeable to the light of Nature, ≈øet down in the Judicial heads of Law, which will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to govern all Nations by; take two Laws for example, Murder and Theft.</p>
                     <p>The fir≈øt is the head-Law of mankinde towards his like, the prime end of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtracy being to pre≈øerve life.</p>
                     <p>The next is goods; Now in this I finde no loo≈øe to the Magi≈øtrate, but life mu≈øt be for life; if murder, that is, lieing in waite, or as with us malice before hand; in this the Magi≈øtrate hath no liberty to ingratiate in refined Rea≈øon; it lies upon the Land, if not expiated with the blood of the offender, and ≈øo upon the City, and ≈øo upon the Army.</p>
                     <p>But the chief guilt ≈øurely lies upon the chief Magi≈øtrate, who is the prime in tru≈øt executive as to the fact; this ≈øure is, and ought to be death in all Nations.</p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:105181:71"/>
                     <p>The like head-Rule of common Ju≈øtice is in the Law of the man≈ølaier at unawares; and ≈øurely of this ≈øort there will be no doubt, nor of the expiation of incertain mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which ought to be ≈øetled rightly by an Oath of Inqui≈øition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the great quaere will be concerning Theft, which is the matter mo≈øt, or with the mo≈øt to be con≈øidered, as a grould of controver≈øie.</p>
                     <p>For the mo≈øt of Chri≈øtian Nations have made it death, yet the Judicial maketh it death in no kinde, That puni≈øhing life with life, and goods with goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the rule of proportionate Ju≈øtice.</p>
                     <p>Now this alteration is not without rea≈øon as things ≈øtand, that is, upon the received principles forementioned out of the ≈øeeming contrariety which Chri≈øtians have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the Law Judicial, and Apo≈øtolical.</p>
                     <p>For they have gathered, that Chri≈øts Kingdom being of brothers, there ≈øhould be no ≈øervants; that is, no ≈ølavi≈øh ≈øervitude, or bondmen, which was the i≈ø≈øue of not ≈øatisfying what was ≈øtollen with the <hi>Jew;</hi> and upon this pre≈øumption, they at la≈øt wholly abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, as to Theft, the mulcts of two, three, four, or ≈øeven-fold re≈øtored for his life, and took away his life; now this being onely practice, cannot determine the Controver≈øie.</p>
                     <p>Let us then ≈øee the Rea≈øons if any be, whereof the mo≈øt eminent is that of Magi≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Intere≈øt, whereby he would wave a limitation, or rule in ordinary, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf ab≈øolute in every condition.</p>
                     <p>For Supremacy generally aims at ab≈øolute Power in all e≈øtates, Royal, or Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or mixt, though they maintain their intere≈øt diver≈øly, according to evident princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, upon which their foundation ≈øtands; this therefore is a Politick rule; but how warranted by Supremacy of Rea≈øon, upon the pure principle of common or univer≈øal good, or what Rule in the Word, mu≈øt be examined; in the written Word there is owned nothing as clear; for ≈øure then the controver≈øie with ≈øome one good Magi≈øtrate, or Commomwealth or other would be determined, and the intere≈øt of Righteou≈øne≈øs would cloud the intere≈øts of riches, honor, power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This therefore failing, let us ≈øee the Rea≈øon; the fir≈øt part whereof is in nece≈ø≈øity of altering Laws, according to emergencies; to which it is an≈øwered, That Laws in inflicting ju≈øt penalties may be higher or lower according to emergency; and the rigorous, or exact execution may be ju≈øtly inforced; but the incompatibility or di≈øproportion of the Law of Death for Theft is, in that all the goods of a Prince are not of equal worth as goods, be they Hor≈øes, Kine, Gold; Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the head of a Slave, con≈øider him as man: nay, the Lord touches not mans liberty for goods meerly, if he had wherewith to re≈øtore; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Rea≈øon will not avail.</p>
                     <p>But if we con≈øider the Quaere a little further, there will appear le≈øs rea≈øon yet; and that is, that even Chri≈øtians them≈øelves doubt not, but that would the Magi≈øtrate wave his advantages, both to him≈øelf, Clerks, Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the death of Felons, and ≈øtrictly ≈øee to the Execution but of re≈øtoring two or three fold, Theft would not be the one hundred part ≈øo frequent as now it is; for though generally it be truth, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation of life is the prime principle of Nature, and he will part with all to ≈øave that:</p>
                     <p>Yet the ≈øpirits of ≈øome men are ≈øuch, being not poli≈øhed by divine precept, that they ≈øcorn to live but as they have been educated; ≈øome will dye rather then labour, and ≈øo Thieve, or commit any villany.</p>
                     <p>Now it is by ≈øome thought the≈øe may be put to death, but the≈øe do not put the≈øe men to death for Theft, but not having to re≈øtore, they impri≈øon them to ≈øatisfie by labor, their wrongs; and if they break pri≈øon they dye for it; ≈øo that death is now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon them, not only by the equity of the Law Judicial, but univer≈øal rea≈øon cutting off this di≈øobedient ≈øon, rooting out this Moth of the Commonwealth; and there is ≈øure much of Ju≈øtice in this; for now with Chri≈øtians to pro≈øecute a Felon (as any other criminous per≈øon) will co≈øt a man in expence of time, and Fees, and other charges, as much as would have kept his Family a moneth, which added to his lo≈øs who would pro≈øecute, yet compound the Law forbids, but I intend ha≈øte.</p>
                     <p>The next rea≈øon is, the Judicials are ≈øo mixed with Ceremonials:</p>
                     <p>To which it is an≈øwered, that many are clear, u≈øe them; the other ≈øearch out how the mixture ≈øtands; for if there be a plain Law of di≈øtributive Ju≈øtice, a nece≈ø≈øary rule for the benefit of Societies, take that; and if there be no corrupt intere≈øt in it, ≈øure it will be accepted by wi≈øe men, though meer Politicians may baulk it, as well as enact it, as King <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. did in ca≈øe of Marriages.</p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:105181:71"/>
                     <p>I am now come to the great head of all, namely that the Judicials were a Law of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, which now is proper to God, Chri≈øtians mu≈øt not fight, war, revenge, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>I could with ≈øome ≈øay I admire the wonderfull goodne≈øs, mercy, long-≈øufferance, patience, &amp;c. of God, who willing to ≈øhew the Riches of his mercy, forbears the ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels of wrath fitted for de≈øtruction.</p>
                     <p>Art thou a Chri≈øtian that objecte≈øt again≈øt the Judicials to elate another Magi≈øterial power then that of the Regiment of the Lord Chri≈øt? for though they were given by <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> they were the Dictates of the prime verity: And where O man ha≈øt thou ≈øuch a pattern!</p>
                     <p>But thou wilt ≈øay, We are Chri≈øtians, and we have no need of Laws?</p>
                     <p>I an≈øwer with <hi>Paul,</hi> If thou bee≈øt the Law to thy ≈øelf, the Law puni≈øhes thee not; Rulers are ≈øet up for the puni≈øhment of evil doers: So ≈øaid the Lord to <hi>Cain</hi> in the fir≈øt two thou≈øand years; And ≈øo ≈øaith the Spirit to the world in the la≈øt two thou≈øand.</p>
                     <p>But ≈øay you, we acknowledge a Law to men, but not Chri≈øtians; Brethren, be not deceived; remember what <hi>Peter</hi> ≈øaith, The unlearned and un≈øtable wre≈øt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to their own de≈øtruction; the place I pitch upon to clear up the Righteou≈øne≈øs of the Law even to Chri≈øtians, is that of the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. from the 8. to 14. There are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of places hinting the ≈øame, I at pre≈øent know none more pregnant; for thence it is plain, that there were then many controver≈øies ≈øtirred by the Chri≈øtian Iews, or ≈øo pretending, concerning the ob≈øervance of the whole Mo≈øaical Law, whether Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial or Judicial.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> had beaten down as much as in him lay, the Ceremonial, ≈øhewing it was but the ≈øhadow, the body was Chri≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning the Judicials particularly there is no que≈øtion, but from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ver≈øes, and from other places it is plain what was intended; for in the 9. ver≈øe, he ≈øheweth wherefore the Law was made.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt Negatively, not for the Righteous, (the foundation of great errors while mi≈øapplied.)</p>
                     <p>Next Affirmatively, for the lawle≈øs and di≈øobedient, ungodly and ≈øinners, unholy and prophane; the≈øe are general.</p>
                     <p>Now he comes to particulars, Murderers, Man≈ølayers, Whoremongers, Buggerers, Men-≈øtealers, Lyers, Perjured per≈øons, and again≈øt all other things contrary to ≈øound Doctrine, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>There is an objection again≈øt this, <hi>viz.</hi> the≈øe things are Morall.</p>
                     <p>To which I an≈øwer, that if you take Morall for the Law of the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they are not literally there; if you intend Moral for what ever is contained virtually under the≈øe heads, the two generals whereof comprehend the whole duty of man to God, and to his brother, all mankind, then the whole Judicial at lea≈øt mu≈øt be therein comprized.</p>
                     <p>If you intend by Moral, what the light of perfect rea≈øon holds forth concerning ju≈øt and good, no man dare ≈øay the Judicials wanted the height of perfect Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon.</p>
                     <p>If you look at it as rectified by Evangelical Doctrine, then it is an≈øwered, that the primitive error is the cau≈øe of our now wandering.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt generally ≈øeeing the errors which have flowed by the Church to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, we confu≈øedly judge this to ri≈øe from the principle of the Judicials, and lay all the pride, covetize, and various intere≈øts of Princes Courts, Judges Fees, and unju≈øt and unnece≈ø≈øary dependancies, Nur≈øes of Heatheni≈øh and dete≈øtable wickedne≈øs, villany and en≈ønaring dependencies to life and liberty of common Societies as well as particular men upon the Judicial.</p>
                     <p>Next it is beleeved, that Chri≈øtians take the Judicials proper to them, as to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totype of the Jew, which might be; but now a clearer light manife≈øts higher things, or is ≈øo pretended to.</p>
                     <p>The main particular and worthy con≈øideration is our formation of Chri≈øtian policy according to the Jewi≈øh Model; for we held all Baptized as Circumci≈øed to be Chri≈øtians.</p>
                     <p>Now of the≈øe, how excellent Chri≈øtians we have, the Gallows, Gaoles, Hou≈øes of Correction for puni≈øhment, and all places of vanity, ≈øuch as almo≈øt the Heathen would
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105181:72"/> blu≈øh at, Drinking, Dicing, Drabbing, &amp;c. publickly known, manife≈øtly proclaim; and though no rents to the State, as at <hi>Rome,</hi> for the Stews; yet to the State≈ømen they enhance Farm Rents, &amp;c. for ≈øurely, were there no advantageous intere≈øts, they would not again≈øt common profe≈ø≈øion be upon ≈øo weak rea≈øons as they are, tolerated, while winked at; yet what is done with the≈øe Chri≈øtians? lo they are puni≈øhed, are they not? Surely no, not one of ten, if one of a hundred; and this puni≈øhment is the ≈øacrificeing for ≈øin; and this pa≈øt, they are if it be but commutation, as clear Chri≈øtians as the be≈øt; and being now become more ≈øerviceable to corrupt intere≈øts, the≈øe ≈øpied out the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Liberties of better Chri≈øtians, which the Judicials not affording a whip for,</p>
                     <p>The Magi≈øtrate mu≈øt be loo≈øed from his re≈øtraint rather then not have an hone≈øt man puni≈øhed; this rai≈øed error upon error, and opened this loo≈øe to the Chri≈øtian to ≈øeek freedom from an unju≈øt Law; and to the Magi≈øtrate, to ≈øeek to puni≈øh at lu≈øt: But if you ≈øee through all the Apo≈øtles Writings, they only forbid the ≈øin; and for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment, look at the Law in general, which ≈øurely they could not intend but of the Judicial.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Commands of Chri≈øt the Lord, and the Precepts of Love, Charity, Patience, forbearance, &amp;c. they are certainly true, and to be ob≈øerved; and then the Quaere or Objection is, what need of Law? The An≈øwer to this is as evident as the other, That the pure≈øt Congregations, Churches, &amp;c. have had, and ever will have evil men among them, not only hypocrites but open ≈øinners; The error of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not ejecting, or Magi≈øtrates not puni≈øhing, or not due regulating by puni≈øhment, rather ≈øhews the nece≈ø≈øity of Law, then the u≈øele≈øne≈øs of it.</p>
                     <p>Now grant that the whole Nation were purely Church-Members, of which no vi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cau≈øe of ejecting or rejecting communion appeared; yet there would or might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øe many debates, differences and controver≈øies, which would require a Magi≈øteriall Authority to determine, if but for difficulty; And ≈øurely the Congregations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians never ≈øo little declining, could not avoid litigations and wranglings; and there being no word to extirpate the Civil Magi≈øtracie, it becomes not Chri≈øtians to wrangle, much le≈øs violently to oppo≈øe ≈øo approved, ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary an Ordance; That opinion that in the ≈øimplicity of the la≈øt Age, as in the beginning, the father of the Family ≈øhall be King and Prie≈øt, hath little warrant; that hath more, that each Saint ≈øhall be ≈øo; and yet in the mean time, as hitherto, ≈øubject to the powers; yea, the Heathen ones, for con≈øcience ≈øake, of the radiancy or glimp≈øe of the Divinity holden forth in them.</p>
                     <p>It is truth, pure Chri≈øtians will not be contentious, ≈øome meek ≈øpirits may and will obey the letter of Chri≈øt; and ≈øure they that do ≈øo in faith, ≈øhall not fare the wor≈øe for their exact obedience; but in the mean-time, this is no binding rule to us, except the words be ≈øo intended.</p>
                     <p>It is truth, the child of God ≈øeeks not his own, &amp;c. he is wholly taken up with God, &amp;c. ≈øhall the Magi≈øtrate therefore ≈øee evil again≈øt him go unpuni≈øhed? Again, love and not avengeing wrongs, and praying for enemies in the ≈øpiritual ≈øence, may ≈øtand with the puni≈øhing, afflicting, and bringing to judgement the body of the tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øor in the literal; yea, God is thereby glorified; otherwi≈øe how can the peace of good men be pre≈øerved again≈øt the wicked, but miraculou≈øly? which we have no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to expect at pre≈øent, and what ≈øhall be hereafter, as the light manife≈øts it ≈øelf, the Lord grant we may walk in it, and al≈øo up to it; and that our Laws may be e≈øtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed according to a rule of Righteou≈øne≈øs, even according to the wi≈ødom revealed by God him≈øelf; and that all emergent Laws may flow from the ≈øame fountain; for for every action contingent there is as is agreed no particular Law already ≈øetled, nor well can be, but the Chri≈øtian Magi≈øtrate ought to provide that not the lea≈øt wrong or tre≈øpa≈øs but be righted or puni≈øhed.</p>
                     <p>I mu≈øt yet remove one rub, and that is, the Judicials have been our mi≈øguider hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, therefore better any other Law then them; 'tis the ≈øame that was objected for u≈øing of formes, whether of prayer or otherwi≈øe which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> u≈øed (and was partly ≈øpoken to before particularly) in that all our old errors having ≈øprung from that root that it is nece≈ø≈øary, yea, ≈øome ≈øay of nece≈ø≈øity, to wave that for our rule le≈øt we tread the ≈øame trace of error, that was before our ruine; and therefore better take our Laws from Turk or Per≈øian, or &amp;c. then from the Judicials.</p>
                     <p>Now let us examine this, and all will appear vain; for fir≈øt it is denyed, that the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105181:72"/> ob≈øerving the Judicials, yea though as binding as the prototype, was the error of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, ≈øo as to bring ≈øo horrible a defection upon our Judicatories.</p>
                     <p>We maintain not (I de≈øire to be rightly under≈øtood) That this Nation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øing Chri≈øtianity, is bound to the <hi>Mo≈øaicall Judicials</hi> in the command to the <hi>Jew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But a≈ø≈øay to manife≈øt that tho≈øe Judicials were not our mi≈øguidance. The Decalogue or Ten Commandements we all agree (except in the ≈øet day of the Sabboth) to hold forth but even what Natures light determinately approves, whereby it is evident that ≈øin is the ≈øame to us as with them, which all the writings of the Apo≈øtles manife≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Now the ≈øin in the head Law being the ≈øame, what difference in the branches, either in re≈øpect of the ≈øeverall <hi>≈øpecies</hi> of tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, or manners of puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the≈øe we all agree the error an error, but we mu≈øt differ concerning the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nfliction of puni≈øhment, which I drive to this head;</p>
                     <p>That the Law pre≈øcribed in the Judicial for puni≈øhment, holds a due proportion, puni≈øhing life with life, goods with goods, &amp;c. if ≈øo, then that the≈øe mediums or rules of due puni≈øhment ought much more to be ob≈øerved by the Chri≈øtian Magi≈øtrate under the Law of the Go≈øpel, the glad tydings of peace and mercy, then by the Jew, and not to outbound, unle≈øs after the utmo≈øt of execution the Law be found evidently defective, which I pre≈øume it never will be under prudent Magi≈øtrates.</p>
                     <p>Now to him that ≈øayes the ob≈øervation of the≈øe Laws was our ground of error;</p>
                     <p>I ≈øay in the Ceremonials of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> it was; and that the receiving of the Judicials might open a gap to introduce that error the more facily, I will not deny; but that this mu≈øt either ca≈øt out the Judicial, or make us take the Rule (for this in any ju≈øt Law I pre≈øume mu≈øt be) from the hand of a Heathen rather then from the word of promi≈øe, is the fruit of ≈øtrong contemplative zeal; for the puni≈øhment, ≈øo it holds its due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, take it from the Turk if you will, or Per≈øian, it matters not.</p>
                     <p>The Turks puni≈øhment, ≈øo it be not Torture, may ≈øuit be≈øt the ≈øpirit or <hi>genius</hi> of the Nation; for to burn, hang, behead, or ≈øtone, all is but death; and this difference, had Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies ≈øo called been lawfull to be enjoyned, might have ≈øtinted our controver≈øie of old between the then ≈øo called Prote≈øtants and Puritans for the receiving the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtures, ≈øet formes of Prayers, Ornaments and Formes of and in Church-Service ≈øo called.</p>
                     <p>And a≈ø≈øuredly it ever hath been one of the Devils gyns, to fright men from truth and right by mi≈øcarriages in the manner, &amp;c. hence cometh the ≈øcandals of profe≈ø≈øion from the errors, if but of one or two hypocritical or mi≈ø-led profe≈ø≈øos; we may as well refu≈øe the Scriptures becau≈øe Heretiques u≈øe them; and that they lead to <hi>Judai≈øme</hi> is a great error; for ≈øurely <hi>Judai≈øing</hi> was intimated in no part of the Judicial Law, of which any que≈øtion can be.</p>
                     <p>For the exception in Fornication, things ≈øtrangled, and blood, the la≈øt two being meats, we are now freed from.</p>
                     <p>There is a holy jealou≈øie which is for God, and is commendable; and there is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy from intere≈øt, which is Idolatrous and wicked; the Lord open mens eyes, e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially tho≈øe in Authority, rightly to di≈øtingui≈øh that they be not found fighters again≈øt God.</p>
                     <p>Now who are to expound this Law, and ≈øettle it, and how far their power extends, is our next task.</p>

                     <p>SOme may think, that the Judicials being laid down to be the fitte≈øt rules for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, or any men to live by, That this Quaere is needle≈øs.</p>
                     <p>For what have we to do with Law-makers, of or among men, when God him≈øelf hath fitted the work to our hand?</p>
                     <p>But the≈øe men mu≈øt know, that time brings to light new inventions of ≈øin, Satan goes about in variety of ≈øhapes and deceives daily, and the≈øe offences many of them will be difficultly referred to the proper head of Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion; therefore it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite that there be a ≈øuperintendency to oreview the≈øe errors and apply a remedy in time according to their rule, yet to puni≈øh life with life, goods with goods, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now the≈øe are various according to the either condition or con≈øtitution of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or both; the con≈øtitution according to ≈øetled Law and con≈øtantly received; the condition time of war or peace.</p>
                     <p>Now the time of war being only accidental, we are ≈øpecially to con≈øider acts done according to the ≈øetled con≈øtitution of the Nation, be it by Monarchy ab≈øolute, or limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or Republique; Republiques of all or any ≈øort; and their boundary is common and publique good, and that either according to emergent nece≈ø≈øity, as in ca≈øe the elders of <hi>Gibeah</hi> had con≈øented to have all their eyes put out for National advantage; for in ≈øuch a ca≈øe the elders had turned evident Traytors to their tru≈øts, but to lo≈øe one or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eye.

                     <head>11. What are the proper Rights of the ≈øupream Magi≈øtrate, ≈øo called, Prerogative.</head>
                     <p>NOw in the handling of this Que≈øtion it is fit a little to open what is Prerogative; now this ≈øimply taken, is the Priviledge or preheminence that one party hath, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther above, or before another, and ≈øo is no more then to have that of right and duty, which others have by accident or by favor, as to have the mo≈øt honourable place, to be heard fir≈øt, and ≈øuch like.</p>
                     <p>But to take it in the proper latitude, it is the ≈øum of all tho≈øe powers, priviledges, Rights and Immunities nece≈ø≈øary to the Supream Power, whether per≈øon or per≈øons (according to the ≈øtrict rule) that thereby the people may be the better governed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the loo≈øe rule, that the people may be kept in ≈øubjection, and the glory of the King or Ruler exalted, and that as to ab≈øolute Power over both body and goods.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore to treat of Prerogative in ≈øuch a ≈øence, is vain; for Prerogative is ab≈øolute power; and what the Prince plea≈øeth is his Prerogative, and this was a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly aymed at here.</p>
                     <p>Now Prerogative, according to the ≈øtrict Rule, is of two ≈øorts, that is, more, or le≈øs ≈øtrict; as for example, ≈øome Prerogatives primarily u≈øurped, by time are agreed to, and after con≈øtituted, ≈øuch as our va≈ø≈øalage of Tenures, whether in <hi>Capite,</hi> or that by grand or petite <hi>Serj. E≈øcuage, Knights Service, Soccage,</hi> or <hi>Villenage;</hi> all which the e≈øtates of the Nation have looked upon, and not annulled, but regulated, and the Kings ≈øought to avoid tho≈øe Regulations.</p>
                     <p>Now the more ≈øtrict Rule of Prerogative, is, to give the dues nece≈ø≈øary, and that both for honour, and order, and ≈øafety, which both the other are but as handmaids to; for the etymologicall fautaries, I pa≈øs them, intending to hold out truth in her native ≈øimplicity, without the ammu≈øive garni≈øh of needle≈øs witty vanities.</p>
                     <p>This then agreed, what Prerogative is in general, from hence it may be collected, that what ever is nece≈ø≈øary, or rather of nece≈ø≈øity, to the well being of the whole, is to be in the Supream Power: Now this which is by ≈øome, and generally alledged as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Kings, yet mu≈øt be al≈øo in all Supream Magi≈øtrates, as Dukes, Earls, &amp;c. yea though Va≈ø≈øals or Tributaries to other Princes, and mu≈øt be al≈øo in Republiques, or where the ≈øupremacy of power re≈øts in more then one per≈øon, whether <hi>Ari≈øtocratical, Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gichal,</hi> or the pure Republique, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Democratique</hi> State.</p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:105181:73"/>
                     <p>For the Prerogative is incident naturally to the Supremacy of power, and that of nece≈ø≈øity; for they are the Superintendents of the whole body, and are to have requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øites to that Office, as nece≈ø≈øarily as the father of a Family or any inferiour Magi≈øtrate under him ought to have, to govern in their bounds, precincts, limits and places; and therefore the Law of <hi>England</hi> ju≈øtly in the matter (however in the attribute, or that to admit compari≈øon with the Almighty, might or may offend ≈øome mens eares) by way of illu≈øtrative Analogy, gave a kind of ubiquity or omnipre≈øence to the King, and ≈øo to the ≈øupream Magi≈øtrate, as the fir≈øt part of his Prerogative, his diffu≈øed power (for common good ≈øo ordered) manife≈øting it ≈øelf in all Offices whereby the publick peace (≈øo called the Kings peace) was pre≈øerved, and was nece≈ø≈øary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where.</p>
                     <p>But as more nece≈ø≈øary, ≈øo more apparent in the Courts of Ju≈øtice, all of which were called the Kings Courts, and the Proce≈øs the Kings, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now we being ruled by Laws; for to avoid the inconveniencies afore-mentioned of pu≈øillage and folly, and alterations accidental to the be≈øt of men depraved, through the fall, make this ≈øupream power vertually to re≈øt in ≈øetled Laws, and by them they rule, and ≈øo neither death, folly, nor any kind of wrong, or injury, can by the e≈øtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Law be done or ≈øuffered by the ≈øupremacy of power, ≈øo that truly the Law ≈øaith, the King can do no wrong, that is, the Law by the ≈øupremacy of power, enables him not to do wrong; and to ≈øpeak out the whole truth, to men of the meane≈øt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding; This law, and the right under≈øtanding and executing of it, is the highe≈øt Prerogative of any of Gods Vicegerents, in higher or lower ≈øphears, and is the agreed Rule of common good, as before-≈øaid.</p>
                     <p>Now our great error and delu≈øion of late was to give that to the per≈øon, which was due to the Office, and to ≈øubjugate the Office to the per≈øon, and not the per≈øon to the Office, which the Law would never admit; for the Law, that is the purity, yea, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcendencie of Rea≈øon, leaves the per≈øon of the Prince naked, in ca≈øe of Male Action, though it cen≈øures not in all male admini≈øtration, where it admits him po≈øitively to judge.</p>
                     <p>I ≈øhall give you an example to illu≈øtrate; for if the King enters a mans hou≈øe di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øed, and offers to vitiate his wife, daughter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and be ≈ølain of the father, husband, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is but as the death of an ordinary per≈øon; and truly by the principles of the ≈øetled Law be he known, it is no more.</p>
                     <p>I ≈øhall put but one Example more; A Traytor is by vertue of the Kings Writ, brought before the Judge, Arraigned, and Condemned; the King grants no pardon, (which I ≈øuppo≈øe he in ≈øuch Ca≈øes cannot generally, though it was done cu≈øtomarily) nor u≈øes no legal peaceably way, but by force per≈øonal ≈øets him≈øelf in Act by his Guard to take this Traytor out of the hands of that Ju≈øtice to which in his Politick capacity he hath Sentenced him; and the Sheriffs men defending the Law; and the Guard by the per≈øonal command of the King, ≈øeeking the overthrow of it, by taking away ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally the pri≈øoner; and they fighting about it, and the King running in, he is ≈ølain, it is no murder by the principles of the Law, which owns not the King in this Act of Tort and Force, and takes no notice of the death of that per≈øon as King, who in Law dies not; for the Law cannot now take notice of it, becau≈øe out of his Sphear; by this it is evident to what end the Magi≈øtrate is cloathed with ≈øo called Prerogative, namely the advance of publike intere≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Now, as in this ≈øort, it gives to the ≈øupream Magi≈øtrate the glory of the Courts of Ju≈øtice, and the di≈øpo≈øings of them, as one part of Prerogative; ≈øo knowing the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Supream Power cannot be maintained but by ≈øome ≈øet way, as it ≈øeems the Ancients provided here, ≈øo much of all ≈øorts of provi≈øion, both for the Kings Family, as al≈øo for his Stable, at the ≈øo called Kings price exceedingly abu≈øed, be≈øides the ≈øo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ≈øetled revenues of the Crown, namely Crown lands, Fee-Farm Rents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So it al≈øo provided for Emergencies, and that both for charges upon the ≈øea, and al≈øo for the land by Cu≈øtoms now ≈øo called, Fines, Forfeitures, (wrecks of the ≈øea how unju≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øoever) land de≈øerted of the ≈øea, lands of Ideots, Trea≈øure found, goods without owners, Tythes of lands out of Pari≈øhes, and the like: And upon the≈øe, or any other matter, if any debt did accrue, it was ≈øatisfied to the King, (that the Commonwealth might not lo≈øe) before any private per≈øon could be ≈øatisfied one penny, (the abu≈øe of this was grown intolerable, but I here treat of Settlements) and how long ≈øince it was
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105181:74"/> in the Kings ca≈øe it matters not; for no ≈ølipping of time could prejudice the Kings Title, as in ca≈øe of a common per≈øon, who was tied to ≈øue within ≈øuch a time, or the time might be pleaded in Bar as was ju≈øtly enacted.</p>
                     <p>Now the rea≈øon of this was ju≈øt and good, preferring publike and univer≈øal good before private and particular; yet this proved offen≈øive oft-times, becau≈øe it was made the in≈øtrument to ab≈øolute Inju≈øtice, while re≈øtitution was made to the King, to the evident de≈øtruction of a ≈øtranger, that is a third per≈øon whom the Law left remedile≈øs, yea though utterly undone, and begging from door to door.</p>
                     <p>It was al≈øo for the ≈øame rea≈øon con≈øtrued to be Law, that in all Grants made by the King, they ≈øhould be taken mo≈øt beneficially for him; and that they ≈øhould not erre to any other con≈øtruction then what was manife≈øted in the body of the Grant, that is, the plain letter mu≈øt be taken, and no implicite con≈øtruction of Law ≈øhall be taken advantage of, again≈øt the good of the Commonwealth, as again≈øt a particular party.</p>
                     <p>And la≈øtly, In ca≈øe of Grants it is void, if it appears that the King was deceived in his Grant; truth, the≈øe originally ju≈øt things, after the fatall wi≈ødom of the Law was politickly perfected, came to be made the My≈øtery of Iniquity; for it was ≈øaid, the Grants were made according to the≈øe received Rules for the Kings ≈øole benefit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he that was once made the Kings Officer, was ever after ≈øcandalized for a Knave; and he that was once the Kings Farmor, Grantee, or Debitor, his e≈øtate was alwayes after e≈øteemed incombred.</p>
                     <p>Now this was more feared when it was granted to him by Judgement of the Judges, that he in Temporals might by a Clau≈øe of <hi>Non ob≈øtante,</hi> di≈øpence with any Statute Law; and that though the Statute ≈øaith ≈øuch di≈øpen≈øations ≈øhould be utterly void, as it was in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øeventh; the beginning was in <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, not ≈øo plain; Acts of Parliament bind not the King unle≈øs e≈øpecially named.</p>
                     <p>Now the≈øe unhinged all our Liberties; for by the one he was not bound except na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and by the ≈øecond he might di≈øpence how-ever named; therefore the≈øe, how ever u≈øed, I cannot reckon as legal Prerogative.</p>
                     <p>I now proceed with Prerogative called Ju≈øt; that is, That the King, or Supream Power for the benefit of the Commonwealth, have the e≈øtates of tho≈øe that die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heir; for no private or particular heir being, the publike is rightly preferred; ≈øo if they purcha≈øe who have no right, as Aliens; they have al≈øo given him tho≈øe Royal Mines of gold and ≈øilver, le≈øt ≈øuch things in Subjects ≈øhould rai≈øe them ≈øo high, as they ≈øhould be able by leavying Arms, to conte≈øt for the Supremacy, and attempt a Tyranny.</p>
                     <p>Now this, if agreed, as agreed, is mo≈øt ju≈øt; They gave him ≈øome honorary re≈øpects meerly; as for example; That the Lord ≈øhould not ≈øei≈øe his Villein in his pre≈øence; how ju≈øtly, may well be Quaeried.</p>
                     <p>For if ju≈øt to be done, why not more ju≈øt before him? To which may be added, That Amerciaments, Fines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which had no exact literal Rule, as offences made by Statute puni≈øhable by the Ju≈øtices at Se≈ø≈øions with unlimited Fine or Amerciaments, were ≈øaid to be by vertue of his Prerogative as his Iu≈øtices, that is, they were to Fine at di≈øcretion, that is, according to the nature of the fact, re≈øpect had to the Law; that is, ≈øaving his Freehold, or not to the value of his Freehold; or ≈øo that he ≈øhould not for to pay that Fine be put to ≈øell his Freehold; all which are argued for, with much nicety, little Chri≈øtianity.</p>
                     <p>Now as for the benefit of the Commonwealth the Law put the King into po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others (though by matter of Record) ≈øo it kept him in the State of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; for, for Lands <hi>Jure per≈øonae,</hi> or hereditary at Common Law, the rule of Law extends not to it, as I conceive; therefore the King cannot be di≈ø≈øei≈øed; and many other ≈øuch things, as the goods of Felons, murderers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is, or may be ju≈øt in murder in ≈øome ≈øort (but in no ca≈øe in Felony, but they ought to go to the per≈øon wronged) and in man≈ølaughter, and defence of a mans own per≈øon, there ought to be no right to the Checkquer, not in the Self-defence at all; and in the others it ought to go to the party; for if the Law in forceable ≈øtrikeing give dammage, and more in wounding, and more in Maihem, then mo≈øt in killing, where the life of the criminal is ≈øaved.</p>
                     <p>That of Deodands is in the Law; and I ≈øee no warrant for it, but the meer allu≈øive
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105181:74"/> equity of the Judicial: It is al≈øo ≈øaid to be a part of the Kings Prerogative to have ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Iudges to try the right of his revenues as is the Checkquer; and the differences of his immediate Officers and ≈øervants, as the Steward and Mar≈øhal of his hou≈øe; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of Action again≈øt his per≈øon, The Law by the Ordinance of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, for honor ≈øake, framed it in nature of a Petition; but the Proce≈øs was as again≈øt an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther per≈øon; and ≈øo if Iu≈øtice be upon that, it is ju≈øt, otherwi≈øe not; it will al≈øo admit no wager of Law again≈øt him, and which proved a great abu≈øe, and was unju≈øt; and is no way either honorary or nece≈ø≈øary; he did take men under pretence of being his debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, into his protection to the overthrow of many particular per≈øons and univer≈øal detriment; thus was Derogative.</p>
                     <p>Again, Judgment was never final again≈øt him, but with a figmentitious advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eva≈øion of a ≈øaving his right; and this was al≈øo new and not nece≈ø≈øary.</p>
                     <p>I come to two main and principal ≈øteps to the eminency of Prerogative, alwayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded the Supream power; which are, fir≈øt, That the King hath by his publike tru≈øt, power to do what≈øoever there is no Law again≈øt; So that from hence hath ari≈øen the ob≈øtructions to Laws upon new Cau≈øes; namely, ≈øetling that in the Law which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the King; and ≈øo abridging the Royal Tenure: By vertue of this he created Corporations, and made Denizens.</p>
                     <p>The other was (from Gods appointment to <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øurely) to appoint places, ≈øo called, of Priviledge, like Cities of Refuge; but undoubtedly this was a civility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Kings and Popes, to rai≈øe a benefit to the King, by priviledging: That Charter had many Fees, and then the Pope made it by allowance a Sanctuary, and ≈øo ≈øecured by both powers; what can be doubted? that mu≈øt be ju≈øt where <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> joyn; and the≈øe men, both Pope and Prince did well, they ≈øaved the life, but ≈øquei≈øed the pur≈øe; and none affoord ≈øuch milke more freely then Rogues and Whores, as all Hi≈øtories evidence.</p>
                     <p>This is the ≈øumm of all the Prerogative ≈øo called; that I in this ha≈øte remember, ju≈øt, or unju≈øt, that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> hold forth. The three main pillars upon which the Edifice of Prerogative ≈øtands, all the≈øe being but the Ornaments thereto, are the ab≈øolute power to make Laws, War and Peace, and rai≈øe moneys.</p>
                     <p>Except in ≈øome few ≈øcattered judgements, ari≈øing upon Emergencies, and are not indeed worthy the name of Prerogative, though in our Topical heads of Laws, they be ≈øo ranked, but rather priviledges or Royalties; many of which were obtained by Subjects; for what a Subject may enjoy I count not Prerogative; therefore not Copning of money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor Royal fi≈øhes, nor a hundred matters of the like nature; and wreck is generally dete≈øtable, and the Royalty of grandage abominable; but the generalty of them are ju≈øtly belonging to all men with the Supream Maje≈øty, e≈øpecially tho≈øe favors of errors in pleadings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this Legi≈ølative power was never in the King, nor no rea≈øon it ≈øhould; which alone ≈øhews the Kings in <hi>England</hi> never was ≈øince the e≈øtabli≈øhment of the three e≈øtates the Supream power; for the makeing of Laws was alwayes ≈øince in them, as the body Repre≈øentative of the Nation, and ≈øo the Lords and Commons were put as a Bar to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading Prerogative.</p>
                     <p>Next for war or peace, it was not in the Kings power; his Knights were bound ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Tenures, but not otherwayes; and the ≈øpecial of them not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their ≈øervice, were to be fined nowhere but in Parliament. The la≈øt of them which are the ≈øinews of the war, were always in the peoples hands, never denyed by any King, however ≈øubtilly obtruded upon, as by loans, privy Seals, &amp;c. which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways declaimed again≈øt, and damned by Parliaments.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe were and are nece≈ø≈øary to the Supream Power, but never tru≈øted to <hi>Englands</hi> Kings, a ≈øure ≈øign the Supremacy was not in the King; he knew it nece≈ø≈øary to aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize his power, and for an ab≈øolute ≈øubjection of all intere≈øts to his, to claim that the≈øe were incident and appendixes to the Supremacy ab≈øolute, which he a≈øpired unto.</p>
                     <p>And though the Forts, Ships, Magazines, and appointing Judges, Governors, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, &amp;c. were actually in his power; yet hereby it is plainly ≈øeen to what end, and how trayterous they were to the then true <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Intere≈øts, who ≈øtuck to the King again≈øt the Parliament in this war; but that controver≈øie is be≈øides my task here.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I proceed, and ≈øay that it is nece≈ø≈øary ≈øtill, that the total and ab≈øolute Supremacy hath the≈øe powers, <hi>viz.</hi> of making or giving forth Laws, making Leagues
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105181:75"/> offen≈øive and defen≈øive, denouncing Wars, and e≈øtabli≈øhing Peace, and al≈øo to rai≈øe moneys.</p>
                     <p>Now this I know not denied by any publike and approved Judgement; but the≈øe men have their bounds, their limits al≈øo; for general, common and publike good, is their limit, their chain, and to ≈øee the end of this, it is fit next to ≈øee</p>

                     <head>12. Who is Judge of publike good, and his Rule of Re≈øtraint? and whether it be fit to admit this ab≈øolutely in the Supream Power?</head>
                     <p>THe Kings formerly were not unskilled in the i≈ø≈øue of this my≈øtery, they boulted out what others will bake, who ever eats it.</p>
                     <p>Now it is plain, this al≈øo is required in the Supream Power; for it is impo≈ø≈øible to ≈øettle particular Laws, ≈øutable to each particular occa≈øion; for in the corrupt ≈øtate of man, as the Law is profitable or di≈øprofitable, ≈øo it is relli≈øhed; as for example, in an equal rate, the ju≈øt man likes the equality, and ≈øo doth the covetous; but he ≈øaith, no rate at all; and if an hone≈øt Mi≈øer can be, he approves equality, but he repines at the payment.</p>
                     <p>Now the boundary is evident publike good, and of this in the manife≈øt parts of it are all men Iudges; for though in tran≈øactions of the high affairs of State, the progre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion may not be fit to be made publike, yet the winding up as it is evident, ≈øo the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons of that i≈ø≈øue, may, as ≈øome conceive, fitly be accounted of, at lea≈øt to ≈øome ≈øpecially appointed, who are to be impowred to that particular end, as the <hi>Ephori</hi> or <hi>Spartan</hi> Court, who judged their Kings Actions, the Tribunes at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Democratie at <hi>Athens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this it is an≈øwered, That the condition of the Commonwealth, where the Rulers and Law givers are tran≈øient and per≈øonal, are naturally inclined to more equality in di≈øpen≈øations then Kings, who wholly labour to bring all to the power of their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øors, Princes like them; but the ≈øons of the other are like to be under government.</p>
                     <p>The other reply, that with all men pre≈øent intere≈øt works; and power pre≈øent may if not bound and limited, prove obnoxious, and for private re≈øpects, neglect publike profit in the Republike, as in the Monarchick State; for all are men; nay, experience hath manife≈øted, that many Senators have been corrupted, to the betraying their e≈øtates to the Empire of a Foreigner; never yet a King, but to a≈ø≈øure his Kingdom, and ≈øo he was not corrupted.</p>
                     <p>The other return that the≈øe accidents of the world do not at all conclude more then what was done; The ambition of mo≈øt Princes hath made them true to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, and the Covetize of ≈øome Senators made them fal≈øe to their Country.</p>
                     <p>But the Que≈øtion here is onely of the ab≈øolute judgement of the Supream Power, and that is concluded po≈øitively to re≈øt there in all dubious matters mo≈øt unque≈øtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; but for matters de≈øtructive to common good, or to common Ju≈øtice, or again≈øt Rea≈øon, they are allowed to be accountable.</p>
                     <p>Yet it is again replied the≈øe were the boundaries before to Kings, and are the boundaries to all Powers; all have generally broken in all ≈øorts of Governments; the examples of ≈øubmi≈ø≈øive accounting Supreams are rare; one was found in <hi>Rome,</hi> and one in <hi>Greece;</hi> and to finde two more in all the world is difficult; for who as the≈øe will be buried, and have their daughters married of the publike pur≈øe, when they have the Trea≈øures of a Nation in their di≈øpo≈øe, and may benefit them≈øelves much with little or no hindrance to the State? Pitty it is, the inju≈øtice of great men ≈øhould give ≈øuch cau≈øe of ≈øu≈øpition; and folly were it while men may, not to ≈øet a bound; and not to ≈øet it in the fir≈øt ≈øetlements, makes the propo≈øal for the future difficult, the e≈øtabli≈øhment dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: Therefore they propound, that the Law be e≈øtabli≈øhed as agreeable to the light of Nature, examples of other States, continued experience, and not again≈øt divine in≈øtitution.</p>
                     <p>The wi≈øe and ju≈øt man will ≈øubmit to that in him≈øelf which he holds requi≈øite to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire from an other.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> allowed the King a Judgement of the nece≈ø≈øity, but not che ≈øole Judgement, but that was becau≈øe the Supremacy was not ab≈øolutely in him; and all held fit not to ve≈øt ab≈øolutely Supremacy anywhere but in Law; ≈øo that untill e≈øtabli≈øhed by Law, the matter is in que≈øtion.</p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:105181:75"/>
                     <p>And though the time pa≈øt when the Legi≈ølative power depended upon the Kings will and plea≈øure, by his calling or not calling Parliaments as he plea≈øed, there might be ≈øome difficulty to ≈øettle dubious matters; yet that Bar broken, where can a let be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs we convert our mercy into a judgement?</p>
                     <p>Upon all this it is plain that there are many difficulties in the nature of Prerogative, whereby to under≈øtand it clearly and truly. All States, that is, the Supremacy of power, do labor naturally to advance the ≈øo called Prerogative.</p>
                     <p>And the people generally ayme as much at liberty, but Kings mo≈øt, and they more ≈øpecially where the Crowns go by way of ≈øucce≈ø≈øion; for the great part of per≈øonal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of a King dyes in a State, except the Supream power will continue it (but then it is requi≈øite in ≈øuch an alteration to ≈øettle ju≈øtly, and remedy fore-experienced and evidently fore≈øeen evils) therefore it is requi≈øite that the continued complaints of men, e≈øpecially again≈øt the Kings Butlers, the Clerks of the Pipe, Chequer, &amp;c. in their fees be ≈øetled; for the paying and gaining of a <hi>Quietus</hi> upon a duty to the King, is almo≈øt as much in Fees as the Rent it ≈øelf.

                     <p>To that it is generally an≈øwered, that what power is nece≈ø≈øary for the pre≈øervation of the peace of the Nation or Government, is proper to the Supream Magi≈øtrate; but an obliging power, that is, that ≈øimple obedience is to be given to his determination of but dubious matters in points of either Doctrine or pure Church-Di≈øcipline, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve never was nor will be yielded to him, in matters circum≈øtantially Religious; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe barely civil, was, as generally agreed, and will not now be denyed, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time of Congregating, the place, and other Circum≈øtantials for pre≈øervation of the peace of Church and Commonwealth; yea, if it were upon good rea≈øon, the number that were to congregate, provided there were enough to con≈øtitute a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, might be ≈øet by the Supream Magi≈øtrate, and Chri≈øtians bound to obey; but this is only as keeper of the fir≈øt Table, not of the ≈øecond.</p>
                     <p>Now to clear this, it is to be known, that if it be taken to be the Keeper of the two Tables, ≈øo called, to promote by all lawful means the glory of God, as the good of men, as all good and ju≈øt Magi≈øtrates will and ought, yea if it be by preaching him≈øelf, or them≈øelves, and that either by word or Doctrine as good life, they and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians are the keepers of both Tables, and he or they as ≈øupream in power, and ≈øo as more entru≈øted with means by God, to do mo≈øt for God, then he or they who have the ≈øupremacy, are by way of eminency the ≈øpecial keepers of them, but that they are de≈øigned more e≈øpecially to repre≈øent either the Kingly, Prie≈øtly, or Prophetical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Lord Chri≈øt as head of his Church, without the manife≈øt tokens of more e≈øpecial Grace and divine Revelation, whereby to periodize the Controver≈øies of their own Subjects, holding forth to us under the ≈øame rule the will of God as the Prie≈øts under the Law, is not ea≈øily di≈øcerned, nor will I beleeve be ≈øtrenuou≈øly urged.</p>
                     <p>The ble≈ø≈øings which our Lord and Saviour held forth, were meerly tending to his ≈øpiritual Kingdome, and the propagating of it, and given out to the Apo≈øtles, and in them to all the Church, as mo≈øt ≈øutable to not onely rea≈øon generally, but the rea≈øon of that our King in his Tran≈øactions among≈øt them; of this enough at pre≈øent. I come now to the la≈øt Quaere of the Prerogative of Princes.</p>

                     <p>THis is a great &amp; weighty controver≈øie; truly Magi≈øtrates that de≈øire to be flattered, ≈øtand off, you can hear nothing ≈øafely; for your ≈øafety is your danger; Now what we have ≈øaid before, tends much to the illu≈øtration of this point, that is, the due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration of the end for which Magi≈øtracie is ordained, (for by the Law of pure Naturals no one is above another) namely the pre≈øerving few again≈øt many, weak again≈øt ≈øtrong, and right again≈øt wrong, in Scripture phra≈øe to be a terror to the evil; and to that end not to wear the Sword in vain; ≈øo that while evils are or may be, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtracie is nece≈ø≈øary to be.</p>
                     <p>Now generally the defects and failings of Governors in them≈øelves, are not ≈øimply and alone a cau≈øe of neglect of obedience to them, or the Laws by them; for evil men may be good Magi≈øtrates; but in ca≈øe the Magi≈øtrate ≈øeeks to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105181:76"/> laws, and all Righteous Government, altering or cro≈ø≈øing wholly the end of his ordination; it is in this ca≈øe clear he is not a Magi≈øtrate, but he is a Tyrant, an u≈øurper, an Enemy to Ju≈øtice; but then it is beleeved by ≈øome, that the light or interpretation of this defection is in every man, and ≈øo each man judges, and may ju≈øtly withdraw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and oppo≈øe. This is gro≈øs ignorance; no then every unju≈øt man puni≈øhed, would be ready to rebell, and mi≈øcall his deficiency Revenge of injury to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</p>
                     <p>The Pope by the evill management among Princes of this quarrel, brought the deci≈øion of all the≈øe controver≈øies to his Tribunal, and by the ≈øteps of ≈øeeming ju≈øtice, mounted the Chayre of Antichri≈øt; for he finding that the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Pride, Lu≈øt, Covetize of earthly gods, had rai≈øed up men again≈øt them, and that many halings and pullings were, between the Princes and Potentates of the earth and their Subjects, the one to have all the power in their own hands, the others to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend what they called ≈øometimes Priviledges, ≈øometimes ju≈øt Rights; one while the inheritance of their Ance≈øtors, as what they had contended for and delivered to them, ≈øealed with their blood; otherwhile their proper and natural birthright, as dues to the people, which no Power or U≈øurpation of a Prince could dive≈øt them of; he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litickly holding forth the nece≈ø≈øity of an Umpire, got ab≈øolutely into the Chayr of preheminence, and depo≈øed Kings for plea≈øure, and Kings and Emperors and all for his profit.</p>
                     <p>Who would beleeve, that now after five thou≈øand years experience, the world ≈øhould not be able to unriddle this my≈øtery? the ≈øource of all our controver≈øies is the Judicials not rightly under≈øtood; for a≈ø≈øuredly, the Acts of their Kings is no rule for us or ours; we are to follow them no further then they follow the light, which God gives us all to walk by, that is, if you will look at their King, it mu≈øt be as bounded, not as imitating the Kings of the Nations, as not exalting him≈øelf over his brethren, not as taking away the excellent young men and beautiful Maidens to be his ≈øervants; and if ≈øo that he be under a Rule, then he is not to rule, not onely not evilly, but not ≈øo well as he pre≈øumes he might, unle≈øs it be made parcell of his Rule.</p>
                     <p>But if he breaks this Rule, who ≈øhall enforce?</p>
                     <p>Now in this ca≈øe it is plain, that a Prince, Ruler, or inferiour Magi≈øtrate, doing greater good then his Rule limits, is in an error, e≈øpecially if opportunity were of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that enacted into a Law; for men are men; and to do ≈øo, opens a door of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øie 'twixt him and his people.</p>
                     <p>Next it ≈øtands as a pre≈øident to his Succe≈ø≈øor; La≈øtly, it ab≈øolutely intimates either a neglect of the Law, or ≈øeeking freedom by degrees from it; but if this were evill or detrimental, what remedy?</p>
                     <p>To clear this, there mu≈øt be a difference taken betwixt things partly de≈øtructive to the end of well reigning, and wholly; for unle≈øs wholly de≈øtructive, threatning the whole community, there is no cau≈øe evident; but grant it ≈øo, we mu≈øt then ≈øee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prince be an ab≈øolute Monarch or limited; If ab≈øolute, then it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the greater difficulty; for there being no barr in ≈øuch ca≈øes, betwixt the Prince and lu≈øt, the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of the difference mu≈øt be by the whole community, at lea≈øt the greater part; and if they break out, wo to the Commonwealth, &amp;c. It is the difficulty to do ju≈øt things in ≈øuch extremities, not the inju≈øtice of the thing puts ≈øo many barrs in the way; and the evil truly is ≈øo great, that prudence hath totally waved a liberty of ≈øuch judgings, finding the dear rate Liberty is in ≈øuch ca≈øes purcha≈øed at.</p>
                     <p>But ≈øome Princes have by renewed Tyrannies, tru≈øting to their power, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced the multitude to la≈øh out, and great men for ≈øafetie to head them; but when matters come to this pa≈øs, it is ≈øurely a judgement on both ≈øides.</p>
                     <p>Now all Chri≈øtian Princes held this, that they being all Typed out by the Judicials, they for≈øooth were ab≈øolute Princes, anoynted with holy Oyle, and ≈øo apply all the Texts of <hi>Davids</hi> not daring to ≈øtretch out his hand again≈øt <hi>Saul,</hi> his heart ≈ømiting for cutting off the lap of his garment, hindering <hi>Abi≈øhai</hi> from killing him in his Tent; yet agreeing, the Lord had delivered him into his hand, and that after the Kingdom rent from him, and given by God to him≈øelf, and he with holy Oyle al≈øo anoynted.</p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:105181:77"/>
                     <p>And la≈øtly, for his ≈ølaying the <hi>Amalekite,</hi> who pretended to have killed <hi>Saul</hi> ahis reque≈øt, to them≈øelves, as anointed, &amp;c. and upon this they get the heart to trangre≈øs Laws at liberty, and even do what they lu≈øted, yea inverted the ju≈øt ends of univer≈øal good, for the enhan≈øig of ab≈øolute power to their own ends only, neglecting the publike, claiming propriety in the Rights of the Nation, as in private inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though truly to that end alone any power ab≈øolute or limited cannot be pretended to.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore I ≈øaid the evil of common Rebellions, &amp;c. hence ari≈øing, The Pope the Lord Chri≈øts ≈øervants ≈øervant becomes the decider of the controver≈øies of Princes, when the Lord him≈øelf would not be a Iudge among≈øt ordinary men; and by this ≈øtring were the Princes of the Earth drawn to commit Fornication with this Whore, and ≈øhe thereby ≈øate upon many waters; but if ≈øo be that there be none but the Pope that hath right to depo≈øe Princes, ≈øurely they need never fear.</p>
                     <p>But in ca≈øe they be limited Monarchs, ≈øuch as all Chri≈øtian Princes were, having their e≈øtates Judges of their Actions, whether they were called Dyets, A≈ø≈øemblies, Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Parliaments, they are to be judged by them.</p>
                     <p>Now to know whether they were Judges of their Actions, or not, it is only con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in whom the main and principal part of ≈øupremacy re≈øted, for making and annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Laws, war and peace, and rai≈øing Moneys.</p>
                     <p>For as the≈øe were intru≈øted, ≈øo was the ≈øupremacy and tru≈øt of ab≈øolute power more or le≈øs vi≈øible; and if the E≈øtates had the mo≈øt, then no doubt they may call to account, yea and for ought I can ≈øee can be fetched from any the Texts afore≈øaid, or any other, may be puni≈øhed, but not by <hi>David,</hi> no nor <hi>Abi≈øha,</hi> nor <hi>Davids</hi> ≈øix hundred; The ca≈øe was per≈øonal as to all <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> ≈øo the enmity was private, and <hi>David</hi> and all the≈øe were but particular per≈øons, private men.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore to avoid the danger of general Concu≈ø≈øions and Conqua≈ø≈øions of a Commonwealth, ≈øetled in popular order, it is requi≈øite ≈øo to temper it, that the con≈øtant acting Magi≈øtrate may have a kind of ≈øuperadvi≈øor, and the truly wi≈øe and hone≈øt will ≈øoone≈øt yield.</p>
                     <p>Such as would be Tyrants, if Kings, will only ≈øeek unlimited power in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths; let not this ≈øeem unrea≈øonable; to give pre≈øidents were ea≈øie; but you will ≈øay facts prove not, I have given rea≈øon, and if that will not prevail, what will? the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons are evident; give a divine word, and I am ≈øilent; for all Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> give obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Magi≈øtrates, and let every ≈øoul be ≈øubject, will bear no more water now to free wicked Magi≈øtrates from due puni≈øhment, how high in tru≈øt ≈øoever, ≈øo the puni≈øhment be done duly, then that of <hi>Paul,</hi> Give not a Virgin in Marriage; Force may ≈øuppre≈øs the opinion, but wickedne≈øs of Magi≈øtrates will rai≈øe up their own ≈øtrengths again≈øt them; yea, their confidents will betray them; and if from hence you conclude I hold Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtracie a humane Ordinance, then you mu≈øt agree to what I hold forth; for what man e≈øtabli≈øheth, man may pull down, alter, puni≈øh, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But I ≈øay, Magi≈øtracy is Gods Ordinance, e≈øtabli≈øhed for mans good, and by man admitted under various names and notions; which per≈øons and Offices particular, are the Conventions of men, either by force, which are void, or Conventional and by compact, which being civil, are and may be enforced.</p>
                     <p>Now this is to be known, that this is intended only ≈øtill in Civil matters, wherein ju≈øt and good for the well being of men as men, is intended, not of power or obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in re≈øpect of Religious Duties.</p>
                     <p>There are, as I have ≈øaid before, evils in all States, through the pravity of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ≈øo that it is not the form of Government, but the men, that in Religion and Rea≈øon gives forth ble≈ø≈øings unto a State; and the degeneracie of men was never more then now, and never more then among ≈øo called Chri≈øtians.</p>
                     <p>Blame us not therefore, if we endeavor to beat out the truth; we have ≈øeen the glory of ab≈øolute States, and al≈øo of limited ones, and that both in Royalties and Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; we know the vengeance of the Lord at the la≈øt, which he, we beleeve, will repay upon the heads of highe≈øt, proude≈øt, ≈øtoute≈øt, yea and their children; al≈øo in outward calamities, whether one or more, whither Kings or States, all their abominations with judgements an≈øwerable to his Mercy; and upon this ground we are willing to let the Supream Power loo≈øe.</p>
                     <p>We have ≈øeen the abu≈øes of the≈øe boundaries, and bars to Prerogative, and how they
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105181:77"/> have oft upon unju≈øt grounds engaged people to wars, and brought great evils upon the Nations.</p>
                     <p>We have on the other hand ≈øeen the lawfulne≈øs of their Barrs, together with their conveniencies, tying up the ambitious nature of man, and as they were in≈øtituted, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pre≈øerving a Nation from the gripes of a lu≈øting Tyrant; yea under them we have ≈øeen the excellencies of Order, Government, Temperance, Cha≈øtity, Humility ≈øhine in Princes as in meaner men; and in the Chief Magi≈øtrates, as in the indu≈øtrious ≈øo called Commoner.</p>
                     <p>We have lately ≈øeen at home, and do ≈øtill abroad, that great men in power put the evil day far away; and if they have no aw upon them but the general Audit at the la≈øt day, it is ≈øo far off their con≈øultations, that they are in a mo≈øt lamentable woful ca≈øe who find no mercy with them till that day.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the la≈øt part of this Que≈øtion, and that is how they are to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed.</p>
                     <p>To which it is generally an≈øwered, That they who have the power ab≈øolute, and can puni≈øh, have no rule but prudence, in enlarging or re≈øtraining them; they generally u≈øed bani≈øhment; but this in ≈øucce≈ø≈øive or hereditary alterations, upon the ≈øame ground of prudence, cannot be ≈øafe; therefore ≈øome have immured them, and ≈øtarved them, ≈øome impri≈øoned them, ≈øome cloy≈øtered them, ≈øome privately murthered them; but all the≈øe were acts of pure power and force, and left but an implicite con≈øtruction of Ju≈øtice on their actions.</p>
                     <p>Our new and unparallelled Tran≈øaction doth I know to many ≈øeem Heroick; and if e≈øtabli≈øhed by Law, upon this pre≈øident, would be an admirable adventure, to hold an aw upon the ≈øpirits of great men; and to that end, they de≈øire the explanation of the ≈øupream (power or) Magi≈øtrates Tru≈øts, and in what ca≈øes<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> it ≈øhall be lawful to arraign them, with the ≈øame legal provi≈øions as King <hi>Charls</hi> tyed his own hands in the Act for a Triennial Parliament; but I leave treating of this, le≈øt I grate to no purpo≈øe.

                     <p>The next priviledge is, that being cho≈øen, they being now of ≈øpecial u≈øe and imployment for the publick, them≈øelves, hor≈øes, goods, and menial ≈øervants, were priviledged from Arre≈øts, di≈øtre≈ø≈øes, &amp;c. and only they, (for the law of entertaining by giving prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions was a di≈øpriviledge of the common Subjects, for who≈øe ≈øake only they were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged) and no more (that other being but a meer Royal corruption, by degrees to make them all ≈øeekers of intere≈øts, upon that ba≈øe Maxime that tru≈øts were to their own benefit.)</p>

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105181:78"/> power of Election, and this Speaker they may al≈øo upon good Cau≈øe put out, by the Votes of the greater number.</p>
                     <p>The next priviledge is, That they have a free liberty to treate of all matters; the a≈ø≈øembling by Kings Writ, the being called his great Councel, are honors of Time, and formal, and cannot abridge their nece≈ø≈øary liberty of free Treaty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But their power appears, in that they had the Guardian≈øhip of the peoples Lives, Liberties and E≈øtates; and though in the variety of changes, they did as all mortal Powers do, ≈øometimes ≈øubmit, ≈øometimes inforce, as the condition of Times were; we mu≈øt u≈øe a true foot, and a≈øcribe no more to them then is needful, not plead pre≈øidents, but Supream rea≈øon, by which they therefore might and ought, during the forty dayes Se≈ø≈øion, a convenient time (which by convention ≈øeems the time ≈øet, during which the King could not di≈ø≈øolve them) to receive Petitions from all places, by turning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves into Committees, and hear how matters went with the Nation, upon ≈øuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentations, from the particular Counties, Cities, and Town therein, addre≈ø≈øed to the particular Members, cho≈øen by them for the aid of the whole Nation; and upon the≈øe, to call ≈øome ≈øay the Kings, all agree all the Kings Officers of all ≈øorts to their Accounts, as Trea≈øurers, and that both for Land and Sea; yea Officers of Peace, as all Iudges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of War, as General, or Lord Mar≈øhal, or by what other name, or names on Land; or Admiral, or <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at Sea, Captains of Forts; and all others, who managed the Revenues, ≈øo called, of the Crown, that is for the publike benefit; and this power is coincedent to every Bar to Supremacy.</p>
                     <p>And truely where this is not, it is ea≈øie to believe the Supream Maje≈øty may ≈øoon pretend all is intru≈øted to his own Will, and for his particular benefit: then they may adjudge, and ≈øentence, but not in Committees, but in the whole hou≈øe; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe there is no legal proceeding, and really and purely; this did, and was to re≈øt principally in the Repre≈øentatives of the people, who are the Commons, (the ≈øepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Hou≈øes as with us, and the ≈øingle power of the Lords to Iudge, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to accu≈øe, yet one Court, is much differing from excellent Rea≈øon, if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it) that ≈øo right might be done to the whole Commonwealth, again≈øt the out-breakings of the King, and al≈øo to every particular per≈øon by re≈øtitution again≈øt the wrong doer; yea, though by the Kings Command, or Commi≈ø≈øion, if not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Law.</p>

                     <p>And la≈øtly, that while being men and capable of erring, their fal≈øe judgements, if any were, may be rectified by a new; for it was, and mu≈øt be the priviledge of the≈øe highe≈øt Courts, not to have ought done there by any of the Members que≈øtioned in any other Court, onely Trea≈øon, Felony, and the Peace, which being flagitious, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Rea≈øon admitted no priviledge to; for how could ≈øuch enormous Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øors of the Law be righteous Law-Makers?</p>
                     <p>The la≈øt priviledge is to have pay for their pains, by a (it ≈øhould be equal) rate, upon all the Freeholders in the County; that is, they who legally had, or might have had a Vote in the Choice; and this allowance was to be ≈øet by Parliament; and who could they better tru≈øt with a little of their e≈øtate, then they whom they had formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtru≈øted with the whole? and this was not due till the end of Parliament: So jealous is Rea≈øon of all Supremacy in the corrupted ≈øtate of mankinde.</p>
                     <p>And ≈øurely none that is not actually in this height, but will agree to this ju≈øt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon; and he that is in, if he intends onely a due u≈øe of it, cannot deny it, this is ju≈øt, betwixt the≈øe powers and them for whom they are intru≈øted; for it is plain, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that all eminency of power, is ≈øolely and onely for the ≈øafety of the people; wherefore it is fit to ≈øee wherein that ≈øafety doth con≈øi≈øt, and to that end we ≈øhall Quaere.</p>

                     <head>What is, and wherein the priviledge of a free Subject doth properly con≈øi≈øt?</head>
                     <p>HAving ≈øeen the great and due care of the Law, for the well providing for the Supream Magi≈øtrate, and that it looks at due (both) power and maintenance, and ≈øets limits in it ≈øelf again≈øt all exce≈øs and out-boundings;</p>
                     <p>We now come to ≈øee after the priviledge of the Subject in the body ≈øo called Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentative, the priviledge of every particular man, wherein the Supream rea≈øon hath al≈øo looked at every one but as a Member of the whole, and hath ≈øetled that as the greate≈øt priviledge, to do mo≈øt for the publike welfare, and well and orderly government of all the≈øe, in ≈øuch ≈øort, as not onely the principles of Nature, but the long experience of of ≈øo many Ages, and above all the inlightenments of divine Wi≈ødom, have handled out to us in ≈øuch manner as they are without all que≈øtion.</p>
                     <p>And therefore as it is ≈øufficiently manife≈øted, that particular men are through power, favor, riches, malice, and ≈øuch like, as ready and as de≈øirous to deal unfaithfully, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou≈øly, and inhumanely with their neighbours, as the Prince with the people; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mo≈øt excellent Rea≈øon, ≈øo called Law, and above all the divine Wi≈ødom hath held out Magi≈øtracy to pre≈øerve as afore≈øaid, again≈øt the≈øe evils by due Laws; and the ju≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the≈øe, is the greate≈øt priviledge; and to have them like Gall and Wormwood is the highe≈øt di≈øpriviledge.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øpecial matter wherein we u≈øually place priviledge is, fir≈øt, to Life; ≈øecondly, Liberty; thirdly, Goods; and fourthly, good Name; and the Law for good Cau≈øe re≈øtrains a mans ≈øelf in the abu≈øe or ill u≈øe of the≈øe, as well as pre≈øerves them to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt others.</p>
                     <p>Now that which gives, is of more value and more honorable then that given: The Heathen expre≈ø≈øed it thus, More glorious is it to rule Kings, ≈øet up, and pull down Kings, then be a King; whereby it is evident, That the priviledge of the Subject, is not to live at lu≈øt, do as he li≈øts, revenge injuries, and act Will for Law, whether in higher or lower e≈øtate, that is, the Magi≈øtrate inferior to Tyrannize over the people without controll, nor to execute what laws he hath in his power as he li≈øt, but according to his rule; nor the ≈øubject to abu≈øe his fellow-Subject, in word or deed, much le≈øs to arraign the Magi≈øtrate and his actions with a forked tongue of envy at his plea≈øure, no nor to mi≈øu≈øe or abu≈øe his own time, his e≈øtate, his liberty or power in his place, and di≈øobey all Law, or at le≈øt que≈øtion and wrangle it, how ju≈øt ≈øo ever, if contrary to his intere≈øt; and how plain ≈øo ever, yet to enter a contention meerly for plea≈øure, and through his pur≈øe-potency, to make evil good again≈øt his meaner, or le≈øs favoured neighbour; In ≈øhort, it is not to do what ever evil Cu≈øtome, or corrupt Practi≈øe, or Selfi≈øh intere≈øt calls Law and due right. I ≈øhall give you but one example or two among the many thou≈øands of <hi>Englands</hi> Plague-≈øores, not at all, or not ≈øufficiently provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Being a great Merchant, and might be tru≈øted upon his own Bond for an hundred thou≈øand pounds, takes up ≈øixty thou≈øand pounds, with which, and twenty thou≈øand pounds with a wife for his ≈øon, he purcha≈øes five thou≈øand ≈øix hundred pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> ≈øettles it upon the ≈øon, and his wife, and after breaks; this, and a thou≈øand ≈øuch gallant Cheates are ordinary, and remedile≈øs, though it will be pretended otherwi≈øe.</p>
                     <p>So again, <hi>A.</hi> Merchant of <hi>London</hi> ≈øells upon likeing, at a ≈øet rate, to <hi>B.</hi> a Merchant in <hi>Yarmouth</hi> a barrel of Nutmegs, and ≈øends them by ≈øea by <hi>C.</hi> Ma≈øter. <hi>B.</hi> di≈ølikes them, pays double fraight, as <hi>per</hi> agreement and returns them. <hi>A.</hi> ≈øues <hi>B.</hi> for them, and recovers. <hi>B.</hi> ≈øues <hi>C.</hi> for them and recovers; the value is thirty pound originally, the co≈øts of ≈øuit cometh to one hundred pound, which is as much as <hi>C.</hi> is worth; <hi>C.</hi> upon this being ca≈øt at Common Law, flies into Chancery, or upon <hi>Affida.</hi> di≈øcovers that the truth is, <hi>A.</hi> had the barrel of Nutmegs, which upon the Trial betwixt <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> had been fully proved; but that <hi>C.</hi> not knowing the ≈øervants of <hi>B.</hi> though he knew the name of him to whom the goods were delivered for <hi>A.</hi> his Ma≈øter; and <hi>C.</hi> coming to <hi>Subpoena</hi> him to appear as witne≈øs, <hi>A.</hi> ju≈øtly believing at it ought, that the ≈øhame and dammage mu≈øt at la≈øt light upon him, ≈øheweth <hi>C.</hi> a wrong man, who takes his monye and the <hi>Subpoena,</hi> and appears, but can evidence nothing, and <hi>B.</hi> is overthrown.</p>
                     <p>Now ≈øuch, and the like Cheates, Thefts, yea as bad as Robberies, are not at all, or ≈øo ≈ølightly, and that with ≈øo much charge, puni≈øhed, as is too much ≈øhame for a Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nation holding forth common Ju≈øtice to allow.</p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:105181:79"/>
                     <p>So the wretchedne≈øs of Juries, and the like, which are ≈øo clean perverted from the fir≈øt in≈øtitution, that though many hone≈øt, ju≈øt, wi≈øe Patriots eye the fir≈øt in≈øtitution with great con≈øideration, yet they now ≈øee them with hearts of Regret, abu≈øed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øing their high tru≈øts, and all is pretended the liberty of the Subject: So far hath the corruption of intere≈øts prevailed upon all e≈øtates.</p>
                     <p>To rake in this puddle of Negative Priviledge, were to draw almo≈øt all the ordinary actions and litigations of the Commonwealth into que≈øtion, and arraign all per≈øons in our Apo≈øtate pretending Reforming Age.</p>
                     <p>I will not therefore expatiate, but come to the Affirmative part of the Que≈øtion, and ≈øee wherein the liberty of the Subject doth con≈øi≈øt properly, and con≈øider the ≈øame, as I have done the other, (though tacitely) generally and particularly.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt therefore I ≈øay, that the priviledge of the Subject is to be governed by righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and equal Laws, the Magi≈øtrate executing without partiality, his power, in, and for the pre≈øervation of life, goods, liberty, and good name, according to a ju≈øt, known and manife≈øt Law, for all enormities, tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions, offences, and crimes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                     <p>This in general; In particular, it is to have the Supremacy of power ≈øo ≈øetled, known, and declared, both in point of Revenue, honor, and power, as con≈øi≈øts with the be≈øt ≈øafety of the whole; and that whether it be in a State Monarchical, or Republical.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the Laws by which they govern, be as far as may be certain, plain, and ea≈øie to be under≈øtood.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That this Law may extend to all offenders; and the higher the tru≈øt, the greater the puni≈øhment; and the higher the injury, the greater the recompence.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That as the Laws be evaded, or difu≈øed, or mi≈øu≈øed, or new evils encrea≈øe, for which no head Law is provided evidently; that this at the charge of the publike be ≈øpeedily remedied, that ≈øo the vitious nature of man may be deterred from acting old, or inventing new forms of ≈øinning.</p>
                     <p>That the≈øe Laws may extend to the Magi≈øtrate and Subject, Superior and Inferior in all degrees, Political, and Oeconomical; yea, to the ≈øuperadvi≈øing the e≈øtates of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant, vain, idle Spend-thrifts, (if ≈øuch ≈øhould grow in a decayed State of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which in a well ≈øetled e≈øtate cannot) as of per≈øons under age of management of their e≈øtates, or Ideots, or Lunaticks, for that vitiou≈øne≈øs in full ≈øence is wor≈øe then in a depraved one;</p>
                     <p>Yea, To look to apparel and diet, e≈øpecially drinking, and al≈øo recreations, e≈øpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øo called Gameing; for each mans time growing famou≈øly irregular ought to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by the publike Magi≈øtrate; and ≈øo in barganing and ≈øelling; yea, where a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium may be, to ≈øet it, or the Rule for it; Let not this onely be laid upon the preci≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of Religion; No, the <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Romanes</hi> did by Nature ≈øuch things; and they without the Law becoming a Law to them≈øelves condemn us who have the Law and yet break it; is not deficiency of Judgement wor≈øe then that of age? and the Law of property is not by this broken.</p>
                     <p>Again, It is the priviledge of the Subject, that they have fit Judges, Officers, and Mini≈øters of the Commonwealth, qualified according to the Rules of the Law; and can there be better then men of wi≈ødom, fearing God, and hating covetou≈øne≈øs?</p>
                     <p>Next, That their Salaries be ≈øuch as may be fitting for their places, and not burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome to the Commonwealth, nor their numbers, and yet enough; and tho≈øe fitly di≈øtributed for the ea≈øe of the poor, as ju≈øtice to both them and the rich.</p>
                     <p>That all pro≈øecutions in the Law, whether criminal, or other tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes, injuries, wrongs, or debts, be duly puni≈øhed, le≈øt the Land in general bear the burthen of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular offences<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> well knowing that there are abominations that bring de≈øolation; That the nece≈ø≈øities of the Nation for War and Peace be levied equally and ju≈øtly (and the expences in a ≈øetled way audited and allowed) and that not onely for, or upon man compared with man, but Town≈øhip with Town≈øhip, Hundred with Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and County with County.</p>
                     <p>The great rea≈øon of many Counties not going about, or ≈øo long delaying the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing rates, as to Towns and Per≈øons, was, le≈øt the inju≈øt intere≈øt of Parliament men, appointed for particular Counties, ≈øhould upon the true value of one County appearing, hoy≈øt that up, and never regard the due ballance with others; and therefore that the Law of righteou≈øne≈øs ought to be above the Law of intere≈øt, mu≈øt, as may be, be a≈ø≈øured.</p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:105181:79"/>
                     <p>As for example, If a Town were a poor ≈ømall Fi≈øhing Town, as great <hi>Yarmouth</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> was and not able to maintain a Mini≈øter, as it ≈øeems it was not, and that it had forty pounds <hi>per annum</hi> allowed for one out of the Bi≈øhops lands; after it is able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ten Mini≈øters, and have but one or two, that it ≈øhould yet have the forty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> and other places ≈øtarve; to take this forty pound away, and make it pay duly an equal portion with others, is general and ju≈øt priviledge, and no di≈øpriviledge.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Dunwich, Ri≈øeing,</hi> and forty places in the We≈øt, to ≈øend Burge≈ø≈øes to Parliament, is a di≈øpriviledge, though originally a due and rightly con≈øtituted; for the rea≈øon cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing, the Laws ought to cea≈øe, and ≈øuch rechanges are our Settlements.</p>
                     <p>So ill Cu≈øtomes to be continued for Intere≈øt, and publike Grievances tolerated for private commodity, whether of men or Town≈øhips, as the unju≈øt, illegal, and de≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive keeping the ≈øo called A≈ø≈øizes at <hi>Thetford</hi> at the Brink of the County of <hi>Norfolk in Confinio Comitatus,</hi> which is again≈øt Law, is a great di≈øpriviledge; for it ought to be in the body of the County, or Head-Town; but if that were ≈øeated inconveniently, yet this is unju≈øt and de≈øtructive; for ≈øo incommodious is the place, that the very i≈ø≈øues lo≈øt there (the place not being able to receive the nece≈ø≈øary attendants) are worth, or I am mi≈øinformed by knowing men, as much as the revenue of the Town is worth; yet in driving on this corrupt intere≈øt again≈øt publike good, I hear good men and great pretenders are engaged.</p>
                     <p>And it carries little of weight, except for honorary intere≈øt ≈øake (which alwayes hitherto hath been an u≈øual inlet to corruption) That the Judge, a ≈øtranger to the County, ≈øhould appoint the place, or indeed that the place ≈øhould be but fixed, except in ca≈øes of evident danger to the publike, as plague, famine, publike inundations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiegings, deva≈øtations, or the like; ≈øo that of two accidental evils (not things ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely evil in them≈øelves) the lea≈øt might be cho≈øen.</p>
                     <p>It is likely it will after appear better to take away the ≈øo called A≈ø≈øi≈øes, as to Trials of general actions, and ≈øuch controver≈øies altogether hereafter, as being now become a burthen, rather then ea≈øe to the Subject; for it is evident, the corruptions of tho≈øe meetings continue, if they do not increa≈øe; now ≈øuch things, which were good ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, when depraved, are di≈øpriviledges if after complaint continued.</p>
                     <p>And I wi≈øh therefore onely I could tell where the priviledge of Engli≈øhmen were; I know where it ≈øhould be, and it may be found thus by parcels; but there is ≈øo much rubbi≈øh and lumber amid≈øt the multitude of Officers, Courts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is hard, but we will attempt, as briefly as we may, to offer at lea≈øt, which will di≈øcover ≈øomewhat, though we cannot come through all particulars.</p>
                     <p>In a word Shortly then, Ju≈øtice, and that both for Law and Equity ought to be in the proper County; the Officers known, Fees certain, and not exceeding ≈øo much upon the pound clear dammage; and equity ought not to be ≈øought till Common Law determines the thing fit onely for that Court.</p>
                     <p>La≈øtly, As to this, that no man be out-ballanced in Law, by power, favor, or riches, as Town≈øhips, Cities, and Corporations again≈øt a mean man, yea, if he had never a penny; nor awed from ≈øeeking ju≈øt things for fear of forfeitures of his lands, as Coppy-holders; all of which I ≈øhall in their particulars further inlarge as occa≈øion offers.</p>
                     <p>So that it is plain here, That having and executing ju≈øt Laws ju≈øtly, whereby publike peace and ≈øafety, again≈øt the Superiors, and between equals, and well ordering Mannors and E≈øtates, for publike peace, quiet, and benefit be ob≈øerved, and renewed Laws, is the proper priviledge of the Subject.</p>
                     <p>But as to this point of ≈øafety, we mu≈øt proceed a little further, and that is to look to the power of the Supream Magi≈øtrate in due providing for the peace and wellfare of the people, both among them≈øelves and al≈øo again≈øt others, not by way of Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polizing Trade for benefit or gain, but ≈øecurity of the State: therefore its no di≈øprivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Subject, that none ≈øhould ≈øell Ammunition or Weapons of any ≈øort, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Swords and Knives, but ≈øuch as are authorized by the State; So al≈øo that no one keep an Inn, Tavern, Victualing or Alehou≈øe, for that the≈øe hou≈øes are, and ought to have the Magi≈øtrate their Superadvi≈øors, and an account from them of the nature and number of their gue≈øts, lea≈øt any danger thereby ari≈øe to the State. And in ca≈øe of error or default, the offender to be puni≈øhed; and in ca≈øe of inconveniency, the place to be di≈øpriviledged. Again, Its no di≈øpriviledge to a Free-man to have men attainted of crimes ≈øeverely puni≈øhed; yea in ≈øome ca≈øes, not agreeably to the letter of the (at
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105181:80"/> lea≈øt pre≈øent practical) Law. As for example, a per≈øon dangerous and oft ≈øu≈øpected for criminal matters, as Robberies, Burglaries, Thefts, Cutpur≈øing, and the like, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted by the formal, ignorant, or packed Jury, for want of a clear, more then noon day evidence, which is now with Jurors, through the ≈øervile terrors of ≈øelfi≈øh Judges, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; if ≈øuch a one for the peace and welfare of the Publique be detained in Pri≈øon, made to work, &amp;c. ≈øo one who hath had his Clergie ≈øeveral times; So of gallant Rogues, who live high, and can give no account how they come by their expences, to ≈øecure ≈øuch is no doubt the great priviledge of the Subject.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe matters can never prove prejudicial to ju≈øt or good men in a well ordered State; they tend to the well ≈øetling of any State; and although ≈øome may abu≈øe ≈øuch power again≈øt good men, ≈øometimes; yet this is well known, That that is the evil of men, not of the power; puni≈øh the men, and appoint better; but nece≈ø≈øary power mu≈øt alwayes be upheld.</p>
                     <p>This may be much oppo≈øed by ≈øome whom I have found earne≈øtly to contend that pri≈øoners convict of Theft and Vagrancie, common Milchers and Pilferers could not by the Law be polled, that is, have their long haire cut off, no not when it hath been proved they have made that in≈øtrumental to their roguery. The Cu≈øtome of old will not prevail, but their new fancy, that nothing of rea≈øon is Law, but what we have an adjudged ca≈øe for; this mu≈øt be maintained; for this is their <hi>Diana,</hi> who ≈øo ≈øtickle for Rogues; and therefore they will not do this; but advantageous cu≈øtomes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived or created, though no better and le≈øs rea≈øon; thus they Tyth Mint, Anni≈øe, &amp;c. Its no di≈øpriviledge to be enforced to plant; yea, if a Law were to plant the North and We≈øt ≈øide of each inclo≈øure with fruit trees, and the South and Ea≈øt with Timber and other wood; and when any Clo≈øe were above four Acres, to have one row of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or fruit in or about the mid≈øt.</p>
                     <p>It were no di≈øpriviledge to have all Commons inclo≈øed and improved, a certain quantity only kept for the meer poor of the Town; nay its the only way to advance the Nation, provide a≈ø≈øuredly for the poor, who now all are eaten out by one rich Clown; and make good roads for Trade, and take away the Nur≈øe of poverty.</p>
                     <p>Its no di≈øpriviledge to alter the Heatheni≈øh days of the Moneths and weeks, and idolatrous ones of Saints dayes, Fea≈øts, weeks, &amp;c. Nor to admit no Market or Fayr of ≈øpeciall note, ≈øave on Wedne≈ødays and Thur≈ødays, ≈øo called, that going and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be not at all on the Lords Day; No, nor to take away multitudes of old needle≈øs Fayrs in <hi>England,</hi> the principal end as practi≈øed, being only drinking and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonne≈øs.</p>
                     <p>Its no di≈øpriviledge, to have a Law, that no ground within a certain ≈øpace of a City or walled Town be plowed, but all for pa≈øture, except allowed, and that onely once in a ≈øet quantity of years by the Magi≈øtrate thereto appointed for nece≈ø≈øity, and then not, except only for Roots, Turnips, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Its no di≈øpriviledge to be puni≈øhed for keeping Swine, or u≈øing certain Trades in the heart or great ≈øtreets, or neer thereto, of Cities and great Towns; alwayes provided they be not tolerated under a rent or any payment; to be enforced to ≈øweep ≈øtreets, clean≈øe Vaults, avoid Dunghils; yea if it did extend to the avoiding or purging the belly of other excrements then water, in any place, and not bury it.</p>
                     <p>Its no di≈øpriviledge to have the Magi≈øtrate ≈øet a rate upon what can admit it, nor to puni≈øh the inventors or wearers of new Fa≈øhions.</p>
                     <p>Its no di≈øpriviledge to enforce by Law to Tyle or Slate all hou≈øes in Cities and great Towns.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, a general Law can be no di≈øpriviledge, nor any Law which truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends publique good; the not equal admini≈øtring of that Law, is a di≈øpriviledge; but then the fault is in the Judge, not in the Law, though it may prove very burthen≈øome (as in times of Prerogative) nay de≈øtructive to a particular, which evil will and ought to have a ≈øpeedy remedy by complaint and due puni≈øhment, not by alteration of the Law.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the la≈øt controver≈øie of Priviledge and di≈øpriviledge that I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that is, That men of ≈øuch E≈øtates ≈øhall not (keep Hawks) keep Greyhounds, Guns, ≈øetting Dogs, Nets, and the like; many have que≈øtioned me what benefit we had by all our labours, hazzards, payments, &amp;c. if this were practi≈øed, they had as live the Lord <hi>Matravers</hi> ≈øhould take away their goods, as the Ju≈øtices of the Peace; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105181:80"/> informed, what they did was according to Act of Parliament, what he did by meer power; what he did was to break the hearts of the people, and fit them for ≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; what the Ju≈øtice did was to re≈øtrain the vanity of youth, and keep poor people to labor, that through the vain delights of ≈øporting they might not neglect their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; what he did, was to en≈ølave poor and rich equally; what they did, was only to regulate exorbitancy, and looked onely at inconvenience; they all re≈øolved the thing was ju≈øt, they would willingly ≈øubmit, and de≈øired a certain enforcement of ≈øo ju≈øt, ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary a Law. 2. That trade ≈øhould be regulated; which mo≈øt a≈ø≈øuredly, as to well working, making, fitting, and trimming of matter, is out of all doubt nece≈ø≈øary, if not of nece≈ø≈øity; but as to the times and places of ≈øale, wherein one Merchant or Trade≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may outreach another, and may border upon particular intere≈øt, that is not ≈øo ea≈øily determined; only this the Supream Magi≈øtrate mu≈øt take a note of direction, that there is two evils which to well ≈øettle a free trade mu≈øt be provided again≈øt; Fir≈øt, to loo≈øe a rule which is to place the ≈øuperintendencie of power in the vulgar Artificer, which will at lea≈øt end in confu≈øion; the next is too ≈øtrict a Rule, giving the Ma≈øters of the Company as you may call them, ≈øuch a power as they ≈øhall make Laws, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the execution upon ≈øuch terms as ≈øhall out all Freedom, but only in name; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øome general Rules mu≈øt be laid down, and every County mu≈øt have a Con≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Liberties of Trade, to re≈øtrain from unju≈øt encroachments, either of the poor by multitudes, or rich by power; and this will ≈øurelie≈øt ≈øettle the foundations of all Priviledges.</p>
                     <p>But there is one Priviledge more yet remaining, which is as it were the e≈ø≈øence of all, or rather that which in the enmity of the world doth ≈øecure all the re≈øt; and that is, that the Subject him≈øelf (unle≈øs he forfeits his liberty) be ma≈øter of his proper Arms, and imployed in the ≈øetled Militia of the Nation; For it is by too frequent experience manife≈øted, that the con≈øtant u≈øe or generall imployment of Forreigners (or meer hirelings, though of their own Nation) is an introductive to pure or meer va≈ø≈øalage; and ≈øurely you <hi>Engli≈øhmen,</hi> who think Arms beneath you, as mo≈øt of you of late years have done, are only fit, (as men I ≈øpeak it) to be the ≈øervants ≈øervants whom you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in that ≈øo eminently powerful ≈øervice; And ≈øurely, the lo≈øs of a Nations glory, is, to enervate its Militia, by ca≈øting the honors of that imployment upon men unworthy ≈øuch tru≈øts, as if they and all other places fiduciary, and therefore more honourable, were only agreeable to rich men, which was done only to ea≈øe publick charges, and that made way for this publick ruine.</p>
                     <p>This I ≈øpeak to, as taking it for granted, that the time of the lawfulne≈øs of warrs cea≈øe not among Chri≈øtians, nor that it will, ≈øo long as there is ≈øin and error; and ≈øo a Magi≈øtrate; for what the ordinary Sword cannot reach (yea the ≈øupream Magi≈øtrate him≈øelf in ca≈øe he offend) The Sword of the Lord will. But I ha≈øte, and therefore ≈øhall not enlarge, but open this more by another Quaere, which is,</p>

                     <head>Whether all Subjects have their Priviledges? And whether, and how they may lo≈øe them and regain them?</head>
                     <p>IT is manife≈øt to all men, as it hath before appeared, that there are Subjects by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and Contract, and by power; Nature gives like priviledges to all men; but it gives them not like hearts to ≈øeek after them; all accompt not priviledge the ≈øame; yea, we hear of them who e≈øteem it an honour to be ≈ølaves; but we look higher then tho≈øe Glo-worms; there is no fire or light in their rea≈øonings to us who ≈øay we have the Sun:</p>
                     <p>We therefore con≈øider the ≈øtate, fir≈øt of men, who have joyned together to maintain or acquire freedome again≈øt Enemies or Invadors, and have been overcome.</p>
                     <p>Now here we hold them ab≈øolutely bound to the Law of the Conqueror, and count it not natural wi≈ødom in ca≈øe of utmo≈øt extremity of Tyranny to break out; they can claim nothing of ju≈øt priviledge, they are his ≈øervants, they might have been killed, and to make them ≈øervants was a mercy.</p>
                     <p>And truly I ≈øee no way for ju≈øt (take ju≈øt for a prudent) heading of the≈øe men again≈øt the Conquerour; if for life, they have ≈øworn obedience; what have been
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105181:81"/> the i≈ø≈øue of ≈øuch out-breakings, I pa≈øs not of; matters of fact prove nothing, and this conque≈øt without an Oath, if he u≈øes them but as men pre≈øerved, ingages to faithful ≈øervice untill freedom acquired; their priviledge is to live.</p>
                     <p>And if an equal gets power over his own Nation, it is the ≈øame accounted, how unju≈øt ≈øoever the ground of War fir≈øt was. But in ca≈øe of tru≈øt convented for, and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion granted, as to a Prince without Covenant, there it is otherwi≈øe. By this we now are come to ju≈øt Originals of Government; here I ≈øay the people, the body, or evidently the Con≈øervators of the Tru≈øts, or Guardians of the peoples Liberties, have a power to call to their aid, and vindicate if the Ca≈øe requires, by Arms the peoples Liberties.</p>
                     <p>For here is rational ≈øubjection; and that which is mo≈øt rea≈øonable in the ≈øingle Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is the Obligation of the Prince for his meer tru≈øt; yet that rea≈øon mu≈øt re≈øt in the judgement of the Prince; but this doth ≈øtretch no further then to things good, as in two evils the lea≈øt is to be cho≈øen; but one man thinks this the lea≈øt, and an other that; and ≈øometimes that which was generally thought the lea≈øt, in the i≈ø≈øue proves the greate≈øt; ≈øo in good, the Magi≈øtrate may think that, and the people this, but both evidently good<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> The Magi≈øtrate may ≈øettle either; Now as the Magi≈øtrate is Judge of good, ≈øo is the ≈øubject of evil; that is, what is de≈øtructive to natural priviledges; for this ≈øubject voluntary ≈øubjects him≈øelf for well living, (the Subject to ab≈øolute power is onely to live) untill convention either by Petition or force ingages the Prince.</p>
                     <p>Truth is, ab≈øolute powers acquiring their power by force, have a law upon them, by God among Chri≈øtians, light of Nature amon≈øt Heathens, To do as he would be done unto; but he is while he hath not engaged him≈øelf free; but if engaged to man, bound to man; and man if he hath power again≈øt that power may enforce.</p>
                     <p>It will be objected; Princes will then onely ≈øeek to hold by Conque≈øt and ab≈øolute power and never come to any Convention.</p>
                     <p>To which it is an≈øwered, it is agreed they will not; for its ea≈øie to believe that men will not do what they never would be brought unto; We ≈øee Chri≈øtian Princes by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ≈øeek ab≈øolute liberty; yea, from the Oathes of their Coronation, which is the condition of the peoples ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion; and whereever an Oath is, the people are free Subjects, if the Oath be required by the con≈øtitutions of the Nation, whether the Prince thinks ≈øo or not.</p>
                     <p>Now this is plain to him allows he end of Magi≈øtrates to be the peoples ≈øafety; ≈øo that the ≈øole difficulty will re≈øt upon the powers; but he that looks well into the work, will finde that the u≈øe of power is originally Magi≈øterial, or Magi≈øtratical rather; and that exce≈ø≈øes of power, that is, that power which is not u≈øed and improved duly, is as ≈øubject to re≈øtraint as the failing of particular per≈øons.</p>
                     <p>So that then the powers mu≈øt look to improve them≈øelves ju≈øtly, both backward and forward; behind it ≈øhall ≈øee the Subject free in Nature, and happily before his inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, u≈øurpation, or ju≈øt defence brought him to va≈ø≈øallage.</p>
                     <p>Now then looking at him as a Subject, he ought to yield him protection again≈øt all men, and then due means of ≈øub≈øi≈øtance, that is, ≈øuch as con≈øi≈øts with the ju≈øt ≈øafety of the Conqueror, not contrary among Chri≈øtians to the Rule of Chri≈øtianity; alwayes yet preferring Self-≈øafety; for undoubtedly we mu≈øt agree, that if one hundred take one hundred and fifty, or but one hundred pri≈øoners in War, and have three, or two hundred, or one hundred and fifty more come again≈øt them, and they can ≈øee no vi≈øible way of ≈øafe ingageing again≈øt this three hundred, or two hundred, but by the death of them before pri≈øoners, they may ≈ølay them, yea in cold blood; and they that have written otherwi≈øe, to aggrandize the mercy of a particular Prince, have flattered; for in War (if anywhere) my own life is above that of the Enemies.</p>
                     <p>And if Occurrences ≈øo fall out that ≈øome do not ≈øuch actions, it is rather the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate working of Providence, then the rea≈øon of man, or Rule of legal Prudence; for all know, the impri≈øoned will ≈øeek their liberty with the death of their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaries.</p>
                     <p>And this makes many Conquerors hard-handed in the fir≈øt generation after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øt, till the State be ≈øetled; and to give the due loo≈øe to the≈øe men after ≈øetled by Conque≈øt, is difficult; the men of the world are various in opinion, and much un≈øetled, they are at la≈øt forced to Providence; and yet who ≈øhews what Providence is? and vain it is to talke of Providence, untill we ≈øee what are the tokens of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:105181:81"/>
                     <p>Wherefore before I come to handle how particular men may lo≈øe their priviledges; I ≈øhall a little di≈øcour≈øe of the tokens of Providence whereby a Nation may apprehend deliverances, and ≈øee whether there be any certain enough to engage a Chri≈øtian in what may be called oppo≈øition to Powers.</p>
                     <p>For to a Heathen to have power to try the event for Liberty, is enough to hold his con≈øcience in ≈øu≈øpence, till the i≈ø≈øue to him manife≈øt the pre≈øent will of Providence; but to morrow he will attemp again.</p>
                     <p>But the Chri≈øtian ought to obey for con≈øcience ≈øake the Powers, knowing there are none but of God; and that he ≈øets up and plucks down whom and as he plea≈øes; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chri≈øtians ≈øubmit to V≈øurpers in Acts ju≈øt and lawful, yea to Tyrants; and being enthralled, they ≈øeek liberty ju≈øtly, that is,</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, When God ≈øhall upon their Petitions ≈øtir the heart of the Prince to afford them their ju≈øt dues.</p>
                     <p>Next, They ≈øeek help of their Con≈øervators of Priviledges, if any be; but the≈øe are natural, and ju≈øt to all men.</p>
                     <p>Again, The≈øe ≈øeek not out eva≈øions for Rebellion, ≈øuch as ≈øome call Providence.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let us ≈øee further what we can finde in Rea≈øon; Let a Prince come to the height of private wickedne≈øs, is this a ≈øure ≈øign God hath rejected him? No ≈øure, let him err in many acts of Ju≈øtice to particular per≈øons; yet this will not do, ≈øimply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered; that is, if it ≈øtretches not to an univer≈øal end.</p>
                     <p>Now ≈øome would bound this to the life onely; that is, if the King, or any Supream, did not adventure upon the breach of Laws for ≈øafety of life, there ought to be no oppo≈øition.</p>
                     <p>Others make liberty, others call goods Priviledge; but all agree, that when he holds none of the≈øe, he lo≈øeth the nature of a Prince, and is an Enemy, a <hi>Lycaon,</hi> a Wolfe, and with <hi>Lycaon</hi> or <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to be driven into the Wilderne≈øs till they know the mo≈øt High reigneth over all the Kingdoms of the ≈øons of men, and giveth them to whom he plea≈øeth; and that no Tribe, Family, Linage, or other relation can engage a Duty, but he will incline all hearts, as he did in ≈øeveral ca≈øes among his own people.</p>
                     <p>Some Quaere this yet if it were ≈øo; and ≈øurely God may do it for Judgement: But O Kings, Princes, and all Supreams, know, while there is a body joyned to a ≈øoul, your foul exorbitances will not be continually brooked; but you having led the people into ≈øins with you, God will either puni≈øh you together, or one by another; therefore look not wholly to the ingageing the con≈øcience of your people, while yours have no bounds; yet this is certain, Providence is allowable in difficult ca≈øes and doubful; if we be <hi>in bivio</hi> in a ≈øtreight, at a lo≈øs, and Rea≈øon and Religion both ≈øeem ≈øilent, or ≈øpeak not out plain enough, Providences following ju≈øt means, is a warranting ≈øign of approbation of the righteous God.</p>
                     <p>But in things evidently again≈øt the light of Religion, ≈øetled Law, and good Rea≈øon, Providences I ≈øay onely ≈øo (and mo≈øt men expect no further) a≈ø≈øure not at all.</p>
                     <p>Yet if effected and ≈øetled, we mu≈øt obey; but till then it is our duty to oppo≈øe, which clears us of Turci≈øm.</p>
                     <p>By this it is clear and evident, That for any Nation to make an other its pattern meerly from Similitude is no way warrantable; but their ≈øeveral conditions, in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, not onely of Nature, but of civil Rea≈øon, is to be con≈øidered, le≈øt we ≈øwerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the puddle of confu≈øion, while we ≈øeek the pure ≈øtreams of Government, walking upon the ≈ølippery bank of Providence.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe general heads pa≈ø≈øed, which will to ≈øome clear all the re≈øt; yet to all men of all capacities to which general ≈øort 'tis mo≈øt fit for me to ≈øpeak to, I intend this Treati≈øe.</p>
                     <p>We come now to ≈øee how particular men in their own free Nations, may become ab≈øolutely bound, or more, or le≈øs.</p>
                     <p>Now to this it is plain, that as Nations may acquire power over Nations, ≈øo men over men; yet the generalty of Nations Chri≈øtian have avoided ≈ølavery, ≈øo called, of Chri≈øtians; but why they ≈øhould do it to others, is not apparent, except onely in the di≈øu≈øe, and that di≈øu≈øe come from the evil of ≈øervants multiplying to danger, as ≈øhall be made apparent afterwards.</p>
                     <p>But now, as ≈øome offences become dangerous to life, ≈øome to liberty, ≈øome to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105181:82"/> goods, and ≈øome to honor, ≈øome for a time, ≈øome for ever; as the Law is, ≈øo are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of men, lo≈øt, or regained, and that ju≈øtly; As the <hi>Romane</hi> Mutineers, ≈øome ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed into <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and never ≈øuffered to return, ≈øome but for ≈øeven years, ≈øome untill relea≈øed by the Senate, as they were guilty in degrees, ju≈øt as now they are by Act made uncapable of office for one, two or more years, or for ever at the liberty of the Supream Magi≈øtrate; and ≈øurely ≈øuch penalties will, if prudently improved, prove the greater incentives to tru≈øt and politique vertue.</p>
                     <p>Now as particular men are indulged, ≈øo are Nations, and by faithfulne≈øs or nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are incorporated into Free Societies, as Wales was with us, by which you have the wayes of regaining freedom made plain; the ju≈øtice of them is before di≈øcu≈ø≈øed; but the right of particular men, while acted in due cour≈øe of Law, how ever u≈øurped upon, affords little matter, at lea≈øt at fir≈øt to rai≈øe objections again≈øt the Supremacy of power.</p>
                     <p>This a≈ø≈øerted, to clear all things, if it may be, we will briefly con≈øider the nature of ≈øubjection.</p>

                     <head>Whether Subjection and Obedience be due to the Per≈øon, or to the Power? Whether it be local or univer≈øal, and how con≈øcience binds?</head>
                     <p>BY what hath been ≈øaid before, it plainly appears, that the Law doth, and mu≈øt di≈øtingui≈øh betwixt the Office and Per≈øon of a Monarch, King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all other Supreams upon the like ground, by attributing to them properties incompatible, or no way agreeing with the per≈øon, not onely ubiquity and immortality, but al≈øo infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in their Sphears, that is, not to be able to do wrong, while ob≈øerving their rule; this might be enough ro ≈øome men, if intere≈øts had not made us wi≈øe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to the oppo≈øers we may ≈øeem to look back a little by re≈øolving con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence more clearly, That the intere≈øt of Princes (by all means ≈øeeking to avoid the eternal decree of altering Kingdoms at the plea≈øure of the Almighty, by ≈øetting up, and pulling down at his plea≈øure) ≈øeeking to tie the Subject to blinde obedience, as well in the univer≈øality, as particular per≈øons, without he≈øitation ≈øimply, becau≈øe commanded, is not held forth ≈øo much to a≈ø≈øure the quiet of the people, as to exalt the ab≈øolute power of Princes, to the di≈øhonor of God, and thraldom of Nations; And as before, either power or con≈øent giving this power, the ≈øame re≈øpectively may take it away, except it be a ≈øpecial Ordinance of God; which few, if any, do attempt to make good; neither can that Rule (upon any ground Scriptural or Rational, except God in Scripture giveth a liberty to things ≈øimply unlawful, which who dare aver?) of obeying, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by doing or ≈øuffering, be extended to whole communities, but to particulars, as afore≈øaid, becau≈øe that Nature in the purity of it, intends univer≈øal good; and if the whole body of the Nation agree in it, it ≈øeems to be very evident; but in a knowing Nation, if the mo≈øt knowing, it ≈øeems mo≈øt rea≈øonable; but in a wi≈øe Nation, if the wi≈ødom be corrupted through licentiou≈øne≈øs, as to Gods glory it oft falls out, if the prudent of the Nation not carried away with the≈øe corruptions, agree it, and impowred, though not the greater number, it is lawful, but they ca≈øt them≈øelves on Providence to ≈øupport them.</p>
                     <p>An other thing in this mu≈øt be cleared, that is, to ≈øatisfie intere≈øt (<hi>viz.</hi>) what is the power? To which the An≈øwer is at hand in a double con≈øideration.</p>
                     <p>To clear the Cau≈øe, You mu≈øt con≈øider, that as per≈øons, ≈øo Powers al≈øo may be unju≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Now to the fir≈øt, It is clear, that Obedience is due to the power; That is, if an U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer gets tht Kingdom, while the true King cannot yield protection, you are to give obedience; and if the U≈øurper requires an Oath of fidelity onely, you are to yield to it, that is, lawfully may; but if he requires you to a≈ø≈øert the lawfulne≈øs of his Title, it is unju≈øt to ask, and for you to take, and ≈øeems onely a picking of a quarrel, to bani≈øh, or confi≈øcate, or <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he may do by his power.</p>
                     <p>But you will ≈øay, what if the right King cometh again?</p>
                     <p>I ≈øay in ≈øuch a ca≈øe, you in your place ought to ≈øeek the welfare of the U≈øurper (if behaving him≈øelf ju≈øtly) and ≈øo not condemned by the community; for I give no loo≈øe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105181:82"/> to particular con≈øcience, to judge of publick good or evil) if a Souldier by fighting for him, and ≈øo all in Tru≈øts;</p>
                     <p>Then ≈øurely the Mini≈øter ought not to preach again≈øt him, though not for him, no not to hint ≈øuch matters.</p>
                     <p>And if he that thinks the Prince driven away hath Right, comes under the Sword of that Prince, his oath of fidelity is not extinct, but ≈øu≈øpended, until the right King hath totally ou≈øted the U≈øurper; that Prince may put an oath of oppo≈øition to the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant upon him, but it ≈øeems not ju≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Now the rea≈øon of this is becau≈øe God hath only appointed the Office, not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, and power and convention are the means u≈øuall of acquiring, and God hath been ≈øeen in both; and man not to be wrecked or racked in his con≈øcience, mu≈øt ≈øubmit when God hath determined.</p>
                     <p>Some men think the Prince is to be ≈ølain, and his po≈øterity rooted all out; but the≈øe men plow with the Devils Heifer; from this opinion have horrible cruelties, murthers, deva≈øtations, and inhumanities more then barbarous proceeded, and that among Chri≈øtians, to ≈øecure their unju≈øt and al≈øo ju≈øt acque≈øts.</p>
                     <p>No, it is far ≈øafer to determine his rejection by ≈øuch a total expul≈øion, and make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience ≈øo far univer≈øal, not ≈øo meerly local after oath once taken; but he that thinks otherwi≈øe, and burthens his con≈øcience with it, ought to abide by that particular wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, in doing what he can for the particular right he is engaged unto, until he either ≈øees him re≈øetled, and receives the recompence of his voluntary (I call it only ≈øo) faithfulne≈øs, or peri≈øheth under the wrath of his Adver≈øary, or being better informed reconciles him≈øelf, and ≈øubmits to the power; now this is far more due in doubtful ca≈øes, or where two powers both lawful conte≈øt, or where a lawful power is of many per≈øons, and part of them enter conte≈øt, and ≈øub due the other; This, as I take it, is ≈øufficiently cleared.

                     <p>IT hath been ≈øhewed that univer≈øal good of mankind is the fir≈øt matter eyed in the rule of excellent REa≈øon, ≈øo called Law; next that of Nations; and in Nations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the prudential ≈øettlements of their own, the Rule is, Good is more or le≈øs good as it more or le≈øs re≈øpects or reflects upon the publique intere≈øt and Common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, though the Spirit witne≈ø≈øeth that it was done by Prophe≈øie, yet the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the high Prie≈øt went no further then Common Safety, urging that it was better put the Lord Chri≈øt to death, then the Romanes ≈øhould come and take away the City and Nation; ≈øo the wi≈øe woman of <hi>Abel</hi> in the ca≈øe of <hi>Sheba.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this is plain, that the life of a particular Citizen, is not to be valued with the ≈øafety of a City, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But put ca≈øe, that a Prince requires unju≈øt things, or denounces wars, may the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Kingdom, City, State, &amp;c. ≈øtand out? or if he requires the life of a particular Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, it may be him, in whom the ≈øafety of the place re≈øts, yea if it be the King of Right; as <hi>Jehu</hi> demanding <hi>Ahabs</hi> ≈øon, (it was before Crowned though in a Kingdom ≈øucce≈ø≈øively e≈øtabli≈øhed) I ≈øay, it is meet in this ca≈øe in prudence, to con≈øult ≈øecond cau≈øes throughly; they ≈øeem to do ≈øo; Two Kings ≈øay they ≈øtood not before him, how then ≈øhall we? And in ca≈øe of extremity, they may deliver a ju≈øt man, but not ≈ølay him (as they did <hi>Ahabs</hi> 70. ≈øons, that was wholly unwarrantable) life is the mo≈øt precious.</p>
                     <p>Now to them that object they mu≈øt ≈øtand out as long as they can, we ≈øay ≈øo to: but we may ≈øay prudence may avoid evidently ≈øore≈øeen dangers, yea with the danger of ≈øome ju≈øt men, to ≈øave many ju≈øt men, and ≈øeemingly unju≈øt.</p>
                     <p>For this ca≈øe al≈øo the e≈øtates of particular men may be digged up, high wayes made through them, Bulwarks, Forts, &amp;c. reared, whereby property ≈øeems annulled, yet is only ≈øu≈øpended; but though the Law with us agrees this generally, yet our ≈øo called Municipal Law ≈øeems to deny it in ≈øeveral ca≈øes.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, though it ≈øeem to agree the Law as to Lands, yet it denyes it to ≈øo called per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonal e≈øtate.</p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:105181:83"/>
                     <p>For ≈øuppo≈øe inva≈øion, as for example, the <hi>Scots</hi> (having now many Emi≈ø≈øaries labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (in Pulpit and Pre≈øs e≈øpecially) a ≈øubver≈øion of our new Commonwealth) invade <hi>England,</hi> the Governor of a Town may order erecting Forts, and for pulling down ≈øome hou≈øes in the Suburbs, &amp;c. But for enforcing Moneys from him they know have abundance, and yet know no other means of ≈øupply, the Governor cannot do it, but by Parliament, he mu≈øt be authorized.</p>
                     <p>But the rea≈øon is not thorow paced; for if Lands being the real e≈øtate hath the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, why ≈øhould the per≈øonal be better guarded? therefore to ≈øeek Ca≈øes for the rea≈øon is fruitle≈øs.</p>
                     <p>Truth is, that the difference is not as the one is per≈øonal, and the other Real e≈øtate; but as the one is more properly the ≈øinews of war then the other, and more ≈øubiect to be irrecoverably lo≈øt, and being private de≈øtroyes in ≈øearch the Law of property.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we ≈øhall not ≈øtate the ca≈øe as the meer Lawyer doth, of forcing away money, but of impo≈øing Taxes, as for the pre≈øervation of the place intru≈øted; And ≈øurely, though to avoid the u≈øurpation of Princes in the Jealou≈øie of Liberties, ≈øuch re≈øolutions have been; it is as lawful to lay ju≈øt Taxes upon the e≈øtate, as to erect for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre≈ø≈øes by the labour of the Citizens, and charge them upon Guards, Watches, &amp;c. And to confi≈øcate e≈øtates, or inflict puni≈øhments, and that to death, upon ob≈øtinate and de≈øerving offendors.</p>
                     <p>And this mu≈øt be, or the folly, wilfulne≈øs, or pride of ≈øome few, may be in≈øtrument<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all by evil example, to render all de≈øperate, as too oft experience hath plainly manife≈øted.</p>
                     <p>But the truth al≈øo is, that the ≈øufferings of particular per≈øons ought in equal Ju≈øtice to have ≈øome ≈øort of compen≈øation, tho≈øe e≈øpecially which come from the own party, and not from enemies; for a full recompence if in all ca≈øes, would but lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Civil Jarrs for intere≈øt ≈øake, in the pure≈øt Commonwealths, among men; and have therefore been avoided.</p>
                     <p>By this it is clear, that it is not ≈øo much the diver≈øity of Rea≈øon, as of intere≈øt, that hath brought forth this ≈øeeming Law of contradiction, both ca≈øes being in time of eminent vi≈øible danger, war at the door, allowed and acted by prudent and Ju≈øt men.</p>
                     <p>Now in our ca≈øe let us ≈øee whether the Subject may be ≈øo di≈øpriviledged in time of peace; This will not extend to life, but to liberty and e≈øtate onely, or mo≈øt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly; As for example,</p>
                     <p>Commi≈ø≈øions to Salt-peter-men to dig in the hou≈øes, Cellars, Ho≈øteries, &amp;c. of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate per≈øons, and the like much Quaeried, as almo≈øt every thing is in preparations to great alterations of States.</p>
                     <p>So the putting down of Fayrs, cutting up of Woods in places of Robbery, making Cau≈øywayes through Mar≈øhes or Fens of particular men, yea forcing the ≈øale of Lands, for works of publick nece≈ø≈øity, or it may be of ≈øpecial convenience to the publick, as put the ca≈øe upon the making of Salt, or to plant Sugar, or make Gunpowder, or the like.</p>
                     <p>Now there is no que≈øtion, but they who have ultimate power, have the liberty to enact Laws which ≈øhall with equall Ju≈øtice relieve the publick nece≈ø≈øity, and ≈øatisfie the Right and Claym of the proprietor, yea though he were ob≈øtinate, not only not to admit the entry of his hou≈øe, but al≈øo to convey away his Lands, without the ≈øcandal of <hi>Ahabs</hi> forcing away <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard; for no ≈øupream Power can do that either for honour, profit, or private plea≈øure, without incurring a cen≈øure of unju≈øt; onely the publick good, and that in a more then ordinary manner, can make ≈øuch Acts lawful.</p>
                     <p>For though we may have ≈øalt without the Nation, and ≈øo Gunpowder and Sugar, yet the≈øe being matters e≈ø≈øential to the wel being of a Nation within it ≈øelf, may and ought to be, and will be provided for in a well governed State, to be prudently impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; And for Gunpowder, and ≈øuch like, the State may a≈ø≈øuredly become the ≈øole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters of it, both for making, vending, &amp;c. for ≈øuch things ought to be in the publick Cognizance, or there is little a≈ø≈øurance:</p>
                     <p>Not that I would open a gap to Tyranny; for let unju≈øt Rulers know God will find them out, and their own ≈øtore-hou≈øes ≈øhal be made their enemies Magazines, but
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105181:83"/> to wicked men if they have power, you ≈øhall not need hint what is lawful; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard nought but intere≈øt; for the Judge of this common good I refer you to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Quaere of the ≈øame Nature; and having a≈ø≈øerted that the chief priviledge of the ≈øubject is ju≈øt Laws ju≈øtly executed,</p>

                     <head>How and where the Laws are to be Admini≈øtred; and whether in the Native Tongue? &amp;c. and the times of Judgement.</head>
                     <p>I Find not any Nation in the world, but had ever their Laws in the Native Tongue, and in the due bounds of Cities, Counties, Provinces, or what you plea≈øe to call them, except in ca≈øe of Conque≈øt, or ab≈øolute power, though not at pre≈øent conquering, yet claiming by conque≈øt; and mo≈øtly admitting no gradual appeals, but at a jump from the lowe≈øt Judge to the ≈øupream; I agree an abundance of Rea≈øon in Grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and al≈øo of unrea≈øonablene≈øs; and as with us now practi≈øed, in≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Tyranny and Extortion in mo≈øt ca≈øes, while ≈øeeking Ju≈øtice doubles the dammage original.</p>
                     <p>We all agree walking Courts de≈øtructive; and therefore our Ance≈øtors got tho≈øe of the Kings-Bench, and Common Pleas made ≈øedentary; and wherein lay their in≈øufferablene≈øs, but from the exce≈ø≈øive expence of the ≈øuitor in Travail and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance? if ≈øo, then it is the duty of Judges in Chief, or Law-givers, ≈øo to ≈øettle judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories, that the remedy be not wor≈øe then the di≈øea≈øe; and be ≈øalutary, not only for the wronged, but to the Nation and people; for it is the duty of all members, much more the Supream ones of a Nation, to ≈øee to the evils and ≈øufferings, oppre≈ø≈øions, cruelties and extortions acted again≈øt any fellow Citizen.</p>
                     <p>For what is this mans evil to day, if once made but a pre≈øident, will be ju≈øtified as of Right again≈øt another man to morrow; And if this be anywhere held forth in the Con≈øtitution of Government, it it mo≈øt evident in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique.</p>
                     <p>We all agree the Law is our Rule of well living, and that each man ought to be puni≈øhed if he tran≈øgre≈øs; And the Law it ≈øelf ≈øaith, That no man ≈øhall be excu≈øed for his ignorance; And therefore Laws ought to be fitted both in the Tongue and phra≈øe to the meane≈øt Capacity; otherwi≈øe the Law becometh a ≈ønare, as ours hath been too long.</p>
                     <p>And neither ought there to be ≈øo many, that a man may not well comprehend them; and multitudes of particular Laws is but Civil Popery, as well as holding them forth in an unknown Tongue; And ≈øure in rea≈øon it is as great an error and obliquity to the body and e≈øtate, to ≈øpeak to me the Law in an unknown Tongue, as to the ≈øoul. The open and evident rea≈øons of this my≈øtery is,</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, the <hi>Norman</hi> Conque≈øt, ≈øetling the Law in <hi>French.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next the <hi>Roman</hi> yoak, making pleading in <hi>Latin;</hi> and the Rea≈øons making good this, is the pretext of Learning, which as to the <hi>French</hi> part can never be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; for it is an antiquated Language in it ≈øelf, now wholly di≈øu≈øed; and when u≈øed, then onely in one Province; but ours is neither written, pronounced, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood, as that old Idiome of <hi>Normandia</hi> was.</p>
                     <p>And our Lawyers, to make it wholly private, have u≈øed all means to draw it into the form of a Canting, or Gibberi≈øh; for it is puni≈øhable in Moots to pronounce in the true Dialect; but we mu≈øt u≈øe the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> reading to the <hi>French</hi> writing, or rather <hi>French</hi> corrupted by ignorant Clerks, which rendred our books ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly imperfect, and even the be≈øt of them but by the ≈øence not to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warranted.</p>
                     <p>The private rea≈øons are, fir≈øt, this breeds difficulty, that contention, and that gain to the practi≈øer.</p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:105181:84"/>
                     <p>The next is a quaint one, and would Ju≈øtice and integrity warrant it, might bear ≈øome weight, but there is nothing in the ballance again≈øt Iu≈øtice but wind and du≈øt; This Machivellian rea≈øon is of the corrupt Court, <hi>viz.</hi> men by the≈øe private li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigations, wranglings and contentions, are fired in ≈øpirit each again≈øt other, and ≈øo are taken off projects again≈øt the publick peace of the Nation; but a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian will ea≈øily beleeve this rea≈øon heightens both publick and private ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>
                     <p>Be≈øides this blind rea≈øon makes no di≈øtinction betwixt poor and rich, ju≈øt and wicked men; but put all to the Oare, and let them tug for Ma≈øtery, and the Lawyer ≈øets on the bank, and with their labour is carried into the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean of ≈øo gotten riches; this I pre≈øume ≈øufficiently evidences that the Laws ought to be without any que≈øtion in the Native Tongue, plain, and few, and nigh at hand.</p>
                     <p>Next let us know how we ≈øhould have them admini≈øtred, wherein waving the private intere≈øts afore≈øaid, the matter will be plain; for it is agreed on all ≈øides, That Iu≈øtice ought not to be delayed, no more then denyed, or ≈øold; the Subject deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this, had no more but Iu≈øtice, when it was granted in the ≈øo called <hi>Magna Charta.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now I ≈øuppo≈øe this delay mu≈øt intend, not the cu≈øtomary time of lawing, but the due time, and that peremptorily, except in ca≈øes of ≈øo called E≈ø≈øoyn, that is, when ≈øuch due ca≈øe in Law appears, as all rea≈øon mu≈øt agree there can be no proceeding but with greater wrong to the other party, then the ≈øtay can be to this, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øtice; but the truth is, to have ≈øo many reiterated ≈øummons, formal and co≈øtly, for ≈ømall cau≈øes, is, yea though it were Law, that is formerly ≈øo either e≈øtabli≈øhed or practi≈øed, unfit to be ≈øo continued.</p>
                     <p>And in many ca≈øes, formal proce≈ø≈øes are vain, dilatory and ruinous; and the Subjects priviledge is (that is ju≈øt mens) to have all ≈øuch excre≈øcences cut off, and meet Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine applyed to the wound; the want of which, after ≈øo many Vows, Covenants, Promi≈øes, Engagements, &amp;c. giveth ≈øpirit to the enemy, and ≈øets an edge upon their reproaches, and deadens the hearts of all true friends to Iu≈øtice and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs.</p>
                     <p>Some Nations would never ≈øuffer the Sun to ri≈øe upon a crime unpuni≈øhed, committed after the Sun went down; and ≈øo not go down before puni≈øhed, if acted after Sun-ri≈øe; you mu≈øt ≈øuppo≈øe complained of, and po≈ø≈øible to be effected.</p>
                     <p>But the meaning is, their puni≈øhment was immediate; others gave three days, others fourteen dayes: Now the be≈øt men alwayes give the lea≈øt time, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; delayes, whether in criminall or Civil Ca≈øes, alwayes are the nouri≈øhers of corrupt ends, if not perjuries; our Judicatories are for Civil Ca≈øes in ≈øome places weekly; but the bu≈øine≈øs in formality depends a quarter, half, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a whole year; let there be ju≈øtice done under a penalty: Now the trick is, delay till the Witne≈øs be gone, or hath forgotten it, or can be wrought off, or the Jury fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the turn.</p>
                     <p>The Heathens abhorred what Chri≈øtians practice, for the Criminal part; the Se≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions are or ought to be four times in the year; but the now Lawyers are ≈øo afraid of their own Law; for it is ≈øo doubtful, that few but the Superiour Judges (who by rea≈øon of their places mu≈øt) do or will under≈øtand it.</p>
                     <p>And hence men for ordinary acts lie ≈øometimes twelve moneths, two years in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon by Adjournments, and no penalty upon the Iudge; for he is ≈øeldom evidently faulty, but the Clerks; no Commi≈ø≈øion to try him, or a defective one, whereby the pri≈øoner is without all Remedy.</p>
                     <p>Next the Proce≈ø≈øes for the Tryal before the Iudges, are not every mans purcha≈øe, and the appeal being onely to <hi>London,</hi> the charge which rich men and free men count nothing of, is to poor men de≈øtructive and un≈øufferable.</p>
                     <p>And we had need call for ≈øetled Courts and Laws, and the Judges to determine by a day, under a Fine or Penalty; for in Arbitrary ones, and ≈øo remote as <hi>London</hi> from many parts, and the Clyent mu≈øt go him≈øelf, or his ca≈øe is lo≈øt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:105181:84"/> and undone, where orders are gotten to day, and then the party out of Town, revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to morrow, and Order upon Order, Term after Term, and Judges ≈øittings uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, onely when they can be per≈øwaded together.</p>
                     <p>What is it but the Aby≈øs of confu≈øion, and that which threats mo≈øt direful plagues and judgements to the Nation? let the honour of the Nation be never ≈øo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, yea though the≈øe acts were done to enemies both of God and men ≈øolely and onely; For pure and holy Ju≈øtice is pro≈øtituted, if not ravi≈øhed, nay is then made the Bawd to each exorbitant pa≈ø≈øion and affection.</p>
                     <p>Wi≈øe and Ju≈øt Law-givers mu≈øt therefore ≈øettle Courts in due and fit places, times frequent and ordinary, yea if it were every day, and enforce pro≈øecution under due penalties; And in ca≈øe of appeals (while appeals) which in re≈øpect of difficulties, and that of moment, may be betwixt per≈øons mean and of ≈ømall ability, that they be ≈øetled in due places, and ordered in ≈øuch manner that Right may be done to the meane≈øt, not as in the formal way of ≈øo called <hi>Forma Pauperis,</hi> and all the Proce≈ø≈øes thence i≈ø≈øuing, where the cau≈øe is determinable, all Dilatory Pleas excluded, and errors of cour≈øe amended, and no error pleaded after i≈ø≈øue joyned.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe are principal priviledges of free Subjects; but indeed the highe≈øt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt are lea≈øt under≈øtood, or regarded by the many.</p>
                     <p>Now whether the≈øe Laws be admini≈øtred in the Towns, Hundreds, &amp;c. is in the Supream Magi≈øtrate; ≈øurely in the County and in a due place there, both for convenience of Travaile, and Reception of Suitors, not in <hi>Confinio Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The rea≈øons for and again≈øt this, will not be worth the while, they holding forth nothing of moment, more then what is before declared; onely this, That by this means every County will have a various Law, and carried according to particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øts of places and per≈øons; but this is not be e≈øteemed; for we allow the Supream power the enacting the head Law.</p>
                     <p>So that the Law will be the ≈øame, though the di≈øpen≈øation may be diver≈øe then as it is now, and ever will be; for bind what you can, a wi≈øe Iudge will have or make to him≈øelf a latitude; but if truly wi≈øe, who will grudge? while Iu≈øtice indeed is his onely ayme and end.</p>
                     <p>But to avoid ≈øuch and the like Objections; If the Supream power ≈øettle County Courts, both for Law and equity; and admit once yearly itinerate Iudges, to receive the complaints of Suitors again≈øt all other Iudges; and for determining difficult matters in Law, after the manner of the now A≈ø≈øizes, it will take away all the grounds of intere≈øted objections again≈øt the nece≈ø≈øary admini≈øtrations of Provincial or County Juri≈ødictions, which ≈øome frame from the rea≈øons of County, as Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, Independency, or their ≈øeares of introducing the Churches giving an Analogicall Rule, at lea≈øt, of exteriour Governement, to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                     <p>Now having taken this ≈øhort view of the Laws Admini≈øtration, let us in the next place con≈øider the Qualifications of the Law-giver, and Law-di≈øpen≈øer, whereby Iu≈øtice may be executed ju≈øtly, and how to be cho≈øen.</p>

                     <p>But to aime at the greate≈øt height of perfection po≈ø≈øible, is a duty; therefore in the fir≈øt place, all in places of eminent tru≈øt, ought to be of full and fit age; fir≈øt of full age, which is commonly reputed not under one and twenty years; for though a ripe wit may in the inventive part, in quickne≈øs of apprehen≈øion, and vivacity of ≈øpirit outgo another, yet in the di≈øqui≈øition of parts and ≈øetling the mo≈øt convenient upon a ≈øure judgement, to which experience is requi≈øite, more years ≈øuit be≈øt, and are mo≈øt approvable.</p>
                     <p>Now as too few years are light, neglective, and ≈øubject to ra≈øhne≈øs, ≈øo al≈øo too many years are froward, heavy and ≈øubject to wilfulne≈øs; Therefore the be≈øt rule is for a wi≈øe Commonwealth to fix an age, before which, and after which, no one ≈øhall be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable (no not with a non ob≈øtante) of ≈øuch tru≈øts.</p>
                     <p>Our Law, however practized, and e≈øpecially in the ≈øupream tru≈øts, holds forth ≈øuch a Rule; he that is not thought meet to rule him≈øelf, cannot be allowed to govern a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and if he cannot rule according to Law, how unfit is he to be a promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Law? And the be≈øt way is to make ≈øuch choyces ab≈øolutely void.</p>
                     <p>For the exce≈øs of Age, ≈øixty is accounted a time to cea≈øe Arms, and betake to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. I pre≈øcribe not, but cannot finde a fitter. Nature may often ≈øhorten; She ≈øeldome lengthens that date with that Activity which is requi≈øite in all ≈øuch places.</p>
                     <p>Having done with the age, the next Qualification is ability, not of the body ≈øo much as of the mind; The ignorance of the Judge may be the ruine of the innocent; therefore it is not ≈øufficient that a man hath been Trained up in the profe≈ø≈øion, nor hath been a Reader, no not if he ≈øpent one thou≈øand pound in the Kitchin; but he ought to be wi≈øe among wi≈øe men, who is to rule fools, then ≈øo much more if he be to rule wi≈øe men al≈øo, who may offend; and prudence may reclaim when power is contemned.</p>
                     <p>The next Qualification is, he mu≈øt be free from all po≈ø≈øible obligations to inju≈øtice in any kind; therefore it was unju≈øt in the King to ≈øeek ≈øuch a dependance upon his meer will from the Judges, that they might thereby be drawn from the ≈øtreight path of Ju≈øtice.</p>
                     <p>And it is the ≈øame in all other ≈øupreams; It is truth there is an upright man whom no temptation can mi≈ølead; but we are to provide again≈øt errors; vertue needs no curb, the ju≈øt man is a Law to him≈øelf.</p>

                     <p>Now it is known, Dependance is various in its workings, according to the nature of the man depending; for a timerous nature may ≈øervilely do the Princes Will, without any regard either to honor, or reward; but few ingenuous ≈øpirits are of that muddy temper; the great Mi≈øleaders, are Pride or Ambition, Revenge or Anger, Coveteou≈øne≈øs or de≈øire of Gain.</p>
                     <p>Now there are to be Qualifications requi≈øite in every Judge again≈øt the≈øe; for the≈øe mi≈øleadings vices, or any of them, will otherwi≈øe turn the publike Ax again≈øt the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Enemy; there is therefore great care to be taken at all times, in all choice of men to places of Tru≈øt, but e≈øpecially in times of the ≈øhakings of Nations, for then the wi≈øe man mu≈øt ≈øave the City, how unthought of, how poor ≈øoever.</p>
                     <p>Now to prevent the≈øe, the wi≈ødom of former Ages and Nations have all appointed a ≈øet and bountiful allowance for all Judges, which ≈øtirs up able and active ≈øpirits to eminency of vertue, (which can be never extraordinary, in a meer letter Law, where each Ca≈øe particularly mu≈øt have its examplar) All Nations heretofore agreed puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Judges, and all in the mo≈øt excellent tru≈øts, not onely u≈øeful but of nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ≈øome went ≈øo far, through the fear of Tyranny and Oppre≈ø≈øion by men of eminent parts, that extraordinary abilities were ob≈øcured; for the complaint admitted no Trial, Bani≈øhment mu≈øt en≈øue; after-times tempered this <hi>Laconici≈øm;</hi> finding it was the laying open the State to many Tyrants and Tyrannies to prevent one, that the thing it ≈øelf was the greate≈øt Tyrannie of all. This la≈øt Age went about by all means to explode any que≈øtion of Judges; nay, the Officers of Courts were ≈øo friended, that there was no ≈øeeking Ju≈øtice again≈øt them; but of this more after.</p>
                     <p>In all Judicial places this is fit, That the Judge have his Salary ≈øet, his publike Fee from the Prince or State; now in this one word to this purpo≈øe (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>The Judge receiving this Fee from the State, this is a publike Fee, wherein each Subject hath his portion; and the duty of the Judge in it is, equally to care for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt of both Prince and People or Subject; for the end and re≈øpect of Ju≈øtice is not per≈øonal but univer≈øal; for the qualification of not Covetous, it is of nece≈ø≈øity in a Iudge; therefore as before he is to have a due Salary; ≈øo he is not to take ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Salary, at lea≈øt as a Fee: There is much ≈øcandal at this day in Chri≈øtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths concerning Bribery.</p>
                     <p>In Turky it were no wonder, though till corruption through pro≈øperity u≈øhered in the way, it was a wonder, and a ≈øtrange one among them; but that with them a≈ø≈øures their fall near; for this is like a deadly ≈øore, which if in the Judges, infects the heart, at lea≈øt the prime vital parts of the Commonwealth, and then ≈øure death mu≈øt follow.</p>
                     <p>Thefore it is requi≈øite to have this wound ≈øearched to the bottome; Some for this ca≈øe have been ≈øo ≈øtrict, that they would not admir a Judge to hold familiarity with a father, or a brother.</p>
                     <p>Some not to take a meale, nor any gift, though never ≈øo ≈ømall; others have particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ≈øet down what they may take; and that may do well if they peremptorily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that all not expre≈ø≈øed is included in the negative.</p>
                     <p>From this I ≈øhall take liberty to exemplifie; It is not fit any Iudge receive a New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>years Gift, Gown, Cloth, Veni≈øon, Mutton, or the like, from any practizer at the Law, as well as from a Suiter at Law; for though I would not, nor can I a≈øper≈øe any in place of Authority, yet the≈øe things having been found evil and inconvenient, it is evident then that evil may be.</p>
                     <p>And as good men mu≈øt ≈øhun the appearances of evil, ≈øo wi≈øe Magi≈øtrates mu≈øt take away all things giving ju≈øt occa≈øion of ≈øu≈øpition; therefore it is nece≈ø≈øary, not onely to have the≈øe things ≈øetled by the publike Supream Magi≈øtrate, but al≈øo publi≈øhed, that ≈øo each man may know his duty; and for this ca≈øe it is thought inconvenient any one that takes a particular Fee of any man to be intru≈øted judicially; for many a≈øper≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have lain upon Iu≈øtices of Peace, Coun≈øellors, whether de≈øervedly, or not, I cannot affirm; but it is ju≈øtly ≈øu≈øpected, when they have been more fully informed of the Ca≈øe, and pleaded more earne≈øtly then the retained Lawyer for his vi≈øible Fee; but this is the pre≈øent Opinion and thought of many, who al≈øo conceive it ju≈øt, that a Iudge at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by Bribery, ≈øhould complain to a Iudge duely appointed, and the bribe-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer convicted to be puni≈øhed as well as the bribe-taker; for neither in the Politikes of Chri≈øtianity will be allowed.</p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:105181:86"/>
                     <p>The next Qualification of a Judge is fearing God in the Law; in the Go≈øpel it is the ≈øame, but hath many parts; for ≈øure his qualification ought at le≈øt to be as high as a (≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed lay) Elder; then he mu≈øt be in Church Communion, and not onely not given to filthy lucre, but ≈øober or grave in his behaviour, ruling well his own Family, (which now admitted, it is a hard matter to fill the ordinary ≈øeats in <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter;</hi> for ≈øuch is the loo≈øene≈øs of all Government, that Government is e≈øteemed har≈øhne≈øs, cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, oppre≈ø≈øion, tyranny, and wor≈øe, if wor≈øe may be;) but this is enough to a wi≈øe man; onely this, he mu≈øt not be ≈øubject to Anger, that is overcome of it.</p>
                     <p>And it is the duty of the Chu≈øers of the≈øe men, not to ≈øatisfie them≈øelves ≈øleightly in the≈øe qualifications, nor of the people too readily to a≈øper≈øe; for unle≈øs defects be evident and notorious, Wi≈ødom will cover on the one hand, and fear of puni≈øhment, if that be readily allowed, bridle on the other; for there will be ≈øuch an awe upon ≈øpirits, that whom love of duty and vertue cannot prevail over, fear of vengeance will.</p>
                     <p>I come now to con≈øider by whom the Judges are to be appointed; to which it is ea≈øie to re≈øolve, That it properly belongs to the body Repre≈øentative, none fitter in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary cour≈øe, unle≈øs otherwi≈øe ordered by the Supream Power, according to the e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhment of a Nation; for a≈ø≈øuredly the chief Judges are the Arteries of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and therefore a due and ju≈øt dependance upon the Supream Power is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øite, but never would the Supream look to all admini≈øtrations.</p>
                     <p>And if Judges be in Provinces or Counties as is due, not onely the ≈øedentary at the elbow of the Supremacy, but the chief in the Counties, ought to be at lea≈øt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and authori≈øed (though the nomination may be in the County) by the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; but that all be done in this kinde, by an open plain known publike Law, is mo≈øt requi≈øite.</p>
                     <p>Now before we come to the duties of Judges, we mu≈øt ≈øhew the nece≈ø≈øity of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Qualifications in Judges in point of due temper both of pa≈ø≈øions and affections; for it is before a≈ø≈øerted, that the Judge mu≈øt be bound by a head Law, which takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the pure <hi>Arbitrium,</hi> and al≈øo to puni≈øhments which he may not exceed, and that both corporal (and that as well to re≈øtraint of Liberty, as Correction ≈øo called) as criminal or pur≈ø-paiment.</p>
                     <p>And this Prudence allows an extraordinary care in the due choice, or ≈øpeedy care in removeal of unfit Judges, which is that principally can free from diver≈øity of Laws, according to the divers natures of men, in regard of which diver≈øity of ≈øpirits as fierce and untractable, and quiet and meek, the Magi≈øtrate, as before, ought to have power above what is at all times and to all per≈øons fitting to be u≈øed.</p>
                     <p>We have ≈øeen that the want of this, and putting men for riches, or Family ≈øake, or other outward relations (as of breeding and the like, but no way improveing them) in place and honored with judicial tru≈øts, yea though but a Ju≈øtice of the Peace, hath made Ju≈øtice it ≈øelf either from weakne≈øs or wickedne≈øs di≈øe≈øteemed; whereas let nothing draw from the natural rational Rule, and you ≈øhall ≈øee Ju≈øtice carry that due Splendor and Maje≈øty, which properly belongs to tho≈øe who bear the Image of Gods name in a more e≈øpecial manner.</p>
                     <p>Among Judges, I al≈øo mu≈øt intend not onely Ju≈øtices of the Peace, but Con≈øtables, yea and Jurors, who now are made of men of no e≈øteem, and ≈øo ju≈øtly di≈øe≈øteemed.</p>
                     <p>For Jurors, if they were but bare Judges of fact, yet in that they are Judges, and ought to have their qualifications accordingly; for e≈øtate in them it is nece≈ø≈øary, becau≈øe their disburthen is by dammage.</p>
                     <p>But as to other qualifications, re≈øpectively as others; for the choi≈øe of Judges, as the the Supream ought to chu≈øe the next immediate; ≈øo it ≈øeems to ≈øome, that the Judges gradually ought to chu≈øe; but that ≈øavors more of form then ≈øub≈øtance; for the nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lieth not in the Judge≈øhip, but Supremacy, which if wholly in the order of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, devolves into Tyranny naturally, as on the other hand into confu≈øion if wholly in the populacy.</p>
                     <p>To place it in the Judges, is ≈øolely to e≈øtabli≈øh intere≈øt, which yet being mo≈øt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, is to be waved with greate≈øt ≈øeverity and care.</p>
                     <p>And it ≈øeemeth be≈øt to place the choice of inferior Judges in ≈øome certain men of the people, duly qualified with due regulations of nece≈ø≈øity to be ob≈øerved.</p>
                     <p>One word to their duty, which will on the contrary evidence defaults.</p>
                     <p>The duty of Judges therefore is twofold; fir≈øt, to hold forth practically as well as
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105181:86"/> literally the true and proper ≈øen≈øe of the Law, and not to admit Formality, Practi≈øe, or Cu≈øtome again≈øt the letter, while the letter holds forth ought of Ju≈øtice, in the ≈øetled State at lea≈øt; for that liberty brings all Laws into the meer will of the Judge.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, where they perceive error in Law, which gives ju≈øt cau≈øe of exception, its their duty to declare the ≈øame publikely to the Supream Magi≈øtrate, with a fit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, who≈øe duty it is to enact a due remedy, and e≈øtabli≈øh the ≈øame accordinly, if upon inqui≈øition the ≈øame be found ju≈øt, otherwi≈øe not; and if they do not, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not the tru≈øt repo≈øed in them; for the Supream Magi≈øtrate, though in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratike State (where mo≈øt eyes and ears are at work, and jealou≈øies be highe≈øt) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not di≈øcern each dangerous obliquity in legal admini≈øtrations; therefore they who are intru≈øted, ≈øhould in their places con≈øult for preventing evils as well as for remedying; and this is to have Judges as at fir≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Their puni≈øhments cannot be pre≈øcribed but according to the nature of other offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, life with life, dammage with dammage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But alwayes provided that the error was intentional, and except the guilt were notorious, to di≈øcharge upon Oath, but withall to lo≈øe his place.</p>
                     <p>And to avoid all ≈øcruples concerning Magi≈øtrates Elections, as al≈øo for making and enacting due and fit Laws, and knowing the errors of Magi≈øtrates in all places, that there be re≈øpectively fixed places and ≈øure appointed into which it ≈øhould be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for any man after promulgation of a Law, or nomination of a Judge, to ≈øet down his Opinions and Rea≈øons, for, or again≈øt the altering, or annulling, or rejecting the Law or Judge, before the Law be e≈øtabli≈øhed, or the Judge confirmed, with a mark, no name to appear to make good if required upon the mark, otherwi≈øe the note to be rejected; and the≈øe kept by ≈øome ≈øworn men under ≈øtrict penalties.</p>

                     <p>But the≈øe Appeals are to be allowed under the hands of the Judges of the County, when admitted, and ≈øo by them transferred to the Superior; and if the Appeal be not ju≈øtly grounded, and ≈øpeedily ordered, the Judge to be puni≈øhed, for that he is the Author of delay; but if upon con≈øultation the Ca≈øe be difficult, there mu≈øt be a Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate to the Superior Judges of the truth of the Ca≈øe atte≈øted by the Complainer, who mu≈øt make it good within a ≈øet time, or the Appeal to be qua≈øhed, and he fined, but the Judges excu≈øed.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the remedying of fal≈øe Judgements, mo≈øt certainly Writs of Error were ju≈øtly made u≈øe of and allowed, and the notion of fal≈øe judgement for ≈øo thought good rea≈øon waved, and ≈øo complaints ought to be as afore≈øaid; but this mu≈øt not attend the propounded A≈ø≈øi≈øes without ≈øatisfying the Judgment pre≈øently, yea though it be fal≈øe.</p>
                     <p>Next no error but to be allowed before the Writ i≈ø≈øues forth; for to purcha≈øe the Writ of Cour≈øe, and A≈ø≈øign one Error or more of cour≈øe this Term, then more the next, and then a peremptory day, and then Errors Ca≈ø≈øed, is but legal extortion.</p>
                     <p>So that it is plain, to take errors totally away, is as bad as to have all allowed; but to prevent the mi≈øchief, let a certain day in Court be to determine errors before i≈ø≈øue, and not after.</p>
                     <p>Now the puni≈øhments in the≈øe defaults, are and mu≈øt be pecuniary, and that both in the Judges of Fact as Jurors as well as Law; but where the default is evident, there ought to be a di≈øpriviledging for future as to all publike tru≈øts (at lea≈øt for a time) but
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105181:87"/> out of the Judicial place pre≈øently, yea though the oath be that he was onely mi≈øtaken in Law, and did not do it at all maliciou≈øly, or with a minde of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øtice.</p>
                     <p>Now to oaths, it is fit any Ju≈øtice of the Peace ≈øhould give it at di≈øcretion; this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires able Judges, and ≈øo ≈øhould Judges be; but of this more in due place.</p>

                     <head>Concerning what things the Magi≈øtrate may and ought to make Laws.</head>
                     <p>YOu heard before, that there mu≈øt re≈øt in ≈øome per≈øons thereto de≈øigned, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by God, as tho≈øe who claym to rule by ab≈øolute power, or by men, as tho≈øe who rule by Compact or Convention, as who either had no power, but were meerly elected, and agreed with, having no Right primarily; or had ≈øome power, but not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and ≈øo condi≈øcended to ≈øome rule, that they might rule a≈ø≈øuredly.</p>
                     <p>Now this being in one per≈øon, or more, yet the power ought to extend to all things ju≈øtly nece≈ø≈øary to the well being of a Commonwealth; and therefore they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpectively the general powers of war and peace, life and death.</p>
                     <p>But becau≈øe we have before hinted, that there was a nece≈ø≈øity of the Magi≈øtrates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating of tho≈øe things which many men call di≈øpriviledge to Chri≈øtians as well as men, we will according to the rule before laid, that is of the head Law, according to Gods own Law, the God of Chri≈øtians as of the Jew, ≈øee the Government of rea≈øon laid there down both for Divine and Civil wor≈øhip.</p>
                     <p>Wherein fir≈øt it ≈øeems directly given to the Magi≈øtrate, to have the ordering of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wor≈øhip to God under the Law.</p>
                     <p>Now let us ≈øee how this works; for <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>zziah</hi> is a Leper for acting in the Prie≈øts Office.</p>
                     <p>Yet the aberrations both of Prie≈øt and People are laid to the Kings charge; and the good Kings commanding ju≈øt things, and not onely ≈øo, but ≈øeeing of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, are ble≈ø≈øed; and on the contrary, the evil Kings puni≈øhed, and their Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: And tho≈øe di≈øobedient to the King, as (to <hi>Ahab</hi>) the ≈øeven thou≈øand that never bowed knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> were tho≈øe who were to take root downward, and bring forth fruit upward.</p>
                     <p>Now the great difficulty is, to ≈øettle the Magi≈øtrates power ≈øo that he may not bring ≈øin upon him≈øelf and the Nation, by commanding or tolerating things evil and unju≈øt, or unju≈øtly enforcing things ju≈øt and good.</p>
                     <p>Now as to this, it is to be con≈øidered, that we all profe≈øs Grace is from Heaven, the meer gift of God, and that the Spirit breatheth where it plea≈øeth, as the wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth where it li≈øteth; if ≈øo, the Magi≈øtrate,</p>
                     <p>Yea grant there were a clear Church Magi≈øtrate, that were by divine Word impowred with the Sword of <hi>Paul</hi> as the Keys of <hi>Peter;</hi> could he go further then the outward man? it is plain he could not.</p>
                     <p>Next then, grant no ≈øuch Magi≈øtrate, ≈øure the Civil (or in ca≈øe of doubt of Spiritual Power) the Civil Magi≈øtrate onely can act clearly; Now for the Spiritual Power to be helped out with the Civil Sword, ≈øurely it is one of the gro≈ø≈øe≈øt vanities that Popery ever broached. God ≈øtands not in need of mans wi≈ødome or power.</p>
                     <p>But God having not cleared that the implicit con≈øtruction by Analogical or ≈øingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar rea≈øon from the legall ≈øeverity is proportionate to the gentle and quiet brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Rule of the Go≈øpel, nor agreeable to the Commi≈ø≈øion which our Saviour gives to his Apo≈øtles, which was either to the Jew, <hi>Matthew</hi> the 10. <hi>Mark</hi> the 3. and <hi>Luke</hi> the 9. or to the univer≈øality of men, <hi>Matthew</hi> the 28. <hi>Mark</hi> the 16. <hi>Luke</hi> the 24. and clear enough in that of the 21. of <hi>John</hi> and 15. where nothing is ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of but preaching, and teaching, and feeding;</p>
                     <p>If then the Pa≈øtor have not the Sword but of the Spirit, let us ≈øee the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and Magi≈øterial Sword which is not born in vain; what may this do?</p>
                     <p>If we look to the Jewi≈øh Model which many men ≈øeem ≈øo much to contend
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105181:88"/> for; There we ≈øee that the Magi≈øtrate had power over bla≈øphemers, Idolaters, and tempters to Idolatry, witches, &amp;c. and this extended to death, and that it ≈øhould do ≈øo with us, is by them de≈øired.</p>
                     <p>Now many ≈øuppo≈øe this difficulty, though very great, may be at lea≈øt in great part a≈ø≈øoyled, if we con≈øider that the per≈øons to whom this Law was given, was a people cho≈øen by wonderful miracles and wonders from all Nations, to be the people of God, and bear out to the world the En≈øigns of his ≈øpecial love to man in all Ages and Generations; which tokens of love in obedience to his Law, were ≈øuited with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwerable judgements in the neglect of the ≈øame.</p>
                     <p>And ≈øurely tho≈øe things which relate immediately to God in the point of graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ≈øervice, hold forth nothing to us but a≈ø≈øurance of eternal puni≈øhments to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentant ≈øinner. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> confe≈ø≈øeth him≈øelf a bla≈øphemer, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> the 1. 13. and declaring in the la≈øt times what fearful and horrible ≈øins ≈øhould appear among men, 2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 3. 2. he takes notice of bla≈øphemy and bids onely <hi>from ≈øuch turn away.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if you would have a Magi≈øtrate to work without a divine precept, we mu≈øt look at the height of improved rea≈øon; There we find that zeal for the Gods among all Heathens made bla≈øphemy death; and ≈øurely reverence is due by the light of Nature, to what ever is called God; Of bla≈øphemy under the Law, the Councell was Judge.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> was not of Prie≈øts; they might ask Councel of the Prie≈øt, but determined them≈øelves; and the≈øe by Gods Law put the bla≈øphemer to death; many conjecture upon this, the Devil Aped Gods Law, others his delight in blood hinted the Law, as in Heathen Sacrifices; but ≈øure ≈øuch rea≈øon makes again≈øt the≈øe objects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to take away the pure light of rea≈øon; for who that will acknowledge a Deity, will allow the Deity to be bla≈øphemed?</p>
                     <p>But now the doubt is, whether the≈øe are not under the Go≈øpel to be re≈øerved to the la≈øt Judgement.</p>
                     <p>Some beleeving, that if <hi>Paul</hi> of a bla≈øphemer (and who ever was a greater?) became a Saint, a Preacher of the Me≈ø≈øiah, who did and thought to do many things again≈øt the Name of Je≈øus (that is, again≈øt them called on his name) why may not any other be converted? where is Gods di≈øpencing with the Law? where the ≈øpecial re≈øervation of <hi>Paul?</hi> he did it not again≈øt the humanity of Chri≈øt but his Divinity; it was for calling on his Name.</p>
                     <p>Some excu≈øe <hi>Paul</hi> becau≈øe zealous; but others an≈øwer, ≈øo may any other be e≈øteemed; who ≈øhall venture the judgement of the Magi≈øtrate for bla≈øphemy? ≈øurely there is no word to warrant death for bla≈øphemy, no not of one who hath profe≈ø≈øed Chri≈øtianity, but the old ≈øo called Law.</p>
                     <p>But mo≈øt a≈ø≈øuredly, the Magi≈øtrate hath a great latitude, and may to ≈øome evidently and notorious inordinate liver inflict death.</p>
                     <p>Whereas he who onely from con≈øulting over-curiou≈øly the God-head by rea≈øon, and not comprehending the E≈ø≈øence of the infinite verity and wi≈ødom by his works, ≈øhall doubt, and ≈øo deny God his Power, &amp;c. ought not nor can ju≈øtly be puni≈øhed with death by the Magi≈øtrate: but for ≈øuch the Congregations ought to pray and endeavor; and if yet he cannot be convinced, living civilly and humbly, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate ought to wait with patience, u≈øing all due means, if ≈øo be it may be, that at la≈øt the Lord will reveal this thing unto him.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øame in a manner is to be the rule of Idolatry; for as the mo≈øt horrid bla≈øphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer will allow, if there were a God (for he is an Athei≈øt) he would not bla≈øpheme; ≈øo the Idolater, if this were Idolatry, he would not Idolize, and ≈øo not tempt to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry. For Witches there is much le≈øs doubt; for mo≈øt of them are drawn by malice to renounce God (whom then they mu≈øt own) and dammage men, either of which mu≈øt end in death for death.</p>
                     <p>For Murderers, Buggerers, Burglars, and the like, are without que≈øtion as capable to us of repentance as any of the≈øe, and then no one with Chri≈øtians ≈øhould dye for any offence.</p>
                     <p>And it is plain, as before, that in the Apo≈øtolicall Writings there is held forth nothing of the legal puni≈øhments; <hi>Paul</hi> and all of the Apo≈øtles writing and bending their ≈øpeeches to the Churches, who were faithfull, elected to be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:105181:88"/> Saints; and for the Sinners they were to reprehend and convince, exhort, and per≈øwade, and for greatne≈øs of crime or ob≈øtinacy to ca≈øt out; And <hi>Paul</hi> for all other things leaves them to the Magi≈øterial Power.</p>
                     <p>By which I pre≈øume it is plain, that offending again≈øt the verity and purity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtianity, the Church ought to eject; and offending again≈øt the purity of Righteou≈øne≈øs under Evangelical englightenments, the Magi≈øtrate ought to puni≈øh, according to the Nature of the offence; that the Magi≈øtrate was to follow the Churches cen≈øure as unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to judge of ≈øuch crimes, is not to be moved; or that the Church could not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle until the legal Tryal were ratified, is as contrary to ≈øound Truth: Now if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrate may judge, he may enact Laws as it is plain; from whence I conclude, That the Civil Magi≈øtrate hath the power of Right to e≈øtabli≈øh Laws again≈øt irreligion, <hi>viz.</hi> bla≈øphemy, Idolatry, and tempting to Idolatry, and that in ≈øome ca≈øes with death.</p>
                     <p>In Witchcraft without doubt, unle≈øs you ≈øhall di≈øtingui≈øh in Witchcraft, as in the other between the witch that hath covenanted with the Divel, nouri≈øheth Imps, &amp;c. and does no harm to man in body or goods, and they that do, as in ca≈øe of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øie or bla≈øphemous opinions, private and publi≈øhed, Idolators and inticers to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, leaving the mental and opinionative part to God, and the Active ≈øen≈øible part to man.</p>
                     <p>But ≈øurely this rea≈øon ≈øhould as to Bla≈øphemy, Idolatry, and Witchcraft, have been as well con≈øidered under the Law; for the Rea≈øon ≈øeems to be the ≈øame.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed, under the name of witches I comprehend Enchanters, Poy≈øoners, keepers of familiar ≈øpirits, and all that have entred any actual Covenant with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, be it by word or writing.</p>
                     <p>Now that which evidences to me mo≈øt ≈øtrongly the power of the Civil Magi≈øtrate, in and concerning the≈øe matters, is, that they are called works of the fle≈øh; which to the judicious Inqui≈øitive, will plainly denote the light of Nature might evince them of the contrary; for they are deviations from the pure light of rea≈øon, to bla≈øpheme a God, to wor≈øhip or allure to the wor≈øhip of a ≈øtock, or ≈øtone, or Image for a God, or to make a league with the Divel.</p>
                     <p>But if you ask whether I intend this Doctrine univer≈øally as laid down; I cannot agree it.</p>
                     <p>For fir≈øt to Heathens I allow it not, as abhorring the inference of propagating Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by the Sword.</p>
                     <p>Next I allow it not to ≈øober civil doubting men; for ab≈øolutely prophane and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe ≈øcoffers I yet beleeve, and cannot ≈øee to the contrary but that their blood is upon their own heads; As in ca≈øe of Murder, breaking open of hou≈øes, &amp;c. and what el≈øe the Law doth puni≈øh mortally; this gives much more liberty to men then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore: But what if as <hi>Paul</hi> preached <hi>Diana</hi> &amp;c. to be no gods but the work of mens hands; That a Turk ≈øhould preach publickly the Doctrine of Je≈øus Chri≈øt to be a meer fancy, and bla≈øphemy; In this ca≈øe as a Turk let him be forbidden; if not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let him be bani≈øhed.</p>
                     <p>How can a Chri≈øtian Magi≈øtrate to witne≈øs his zeal to his God, and his endeavour to e≈øtabli≈øh the peace of his Countrey, do le≈øs?</p>
                     <p>But if he be a Chri≈øtian that thus Apo≈øtatizes, the rule is limited before.</p>
                     <p>But the be≈øt way is, where there is ju≈øt doubt, the Chri≈øtian Magi≈øtrate is not to go to the height and rigor of life, but to ≈øeek out with all wi≈ødom, a due remedy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwerable to the light of our Go≈øpel-profe≈ø≈øion, and not cea≈øe till a rule were ≈øet.</p>
                     <p>All the other power of the Magi≈øtrate for the well living of men, might ea≈øily be included in Laws concerning Magi≈øtrates ≈øuperior and inferior, and people, and tho≈øe either living in Cities or Towns, or private families, whether of parents and children, Tutor and Pupils, husbands and wives, ma≈øters and ≈øervants, for all contracts, hou≈øes and lands, bargaining and ≈øelling, &amp;c. words and deeds, man and bea≈øt, night and day, as in warding and watching, peace and warrs, as the ordering, charging, trayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and paying of Souldiers, as al≈øo puni≈øhing of them, health and ≈øickne≈øs, providing for the poor.</p>
                     <p>But ≈øome Judicials which are alterable, may I ≈øuppo≈øe now ≈øeem nece≈ø≈øary, which former Ages di≈øallowed: As for example:</p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:105181:89"/>
                     <p>The Battelling of hou≈øes, le≈øt any ≈øhould fall from the roof, ≈øo the double portion of the elder Brother.</p>
                     <p>And ≈øome ju≈øt and rational Law in≈øtead of the ≈øo called Clergy, for a ≈øafety for ≈øuch offendors as it ≈øhall be thought meet to allow it to.</p>
                     <p>But a City is dangerous, le≈øt a multitude of evil per≈øons might prove obnoxious, except the ≈øtrict Rule of its Government in the ≈øetled inhabitants, may bridle the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancie of ≈øuch evil Gue≈øts; the Law concerning a woman with child, whereby her fruit departs from her, and tho≈øe who procure Abortion, by open force or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate violence.</p>
                     <p>Now although it is plain, that all Errors of Chri≈øtians ought to be reproved with much care, and with all Chri≈øtian information; yet the≈øe ≈øins which are ≈øo plain, are to be plainly enforced by the Civil Magi≈øtrate; but tho≈øe others which are tending to the ≈øervice (not di≈øhonour and bla≈øphemy) of the Almighty, ought to be with much Chri≈øtian per≈øwa≈øion reformed, not by power enforced; for though I mu≈øt agree, the Magi≈øtrate may enforce an Athei≈øt, and ≈øo a Non-Conformi≈øt for fear of puni≈øhment to the Congregation; and he may be there converted, for ≈øome undoubtedly have been;</p>
                     <p>Yet we cannot thence infer, that the work is of duty; he u≈øes indeed a means which rea≈øon is capable of, but to enforce by pecuniary puni≈øhments, much more corporal, is mo≈øt a≈ø≈øuredly ≈øo far doubted, that it is not ≈øuddenly to be acted; for what is for you to day, is again≈øt you to morrow, as the Supream Magi≈øtrate varies in opinion, which Law is then without its certain Rule; and that for which the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate can give no certain Rule, is not to be made by him a Rule or Law at any time.</p>
                     <p>For the Magi≈øtrates making Laws in the≈øe things which tend circum≈øtantially to the ≈øervice of the Lord with Chri≈øtians; I intend the matters ≈øo called of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, ≈øurely therein is the Liberty of Chri≈øtianity, and the glory of it, is, not to be tyed to the Api≈øh formalities of Super≈øtition; conformity and uniformity have been made the great wheels of Satans Chariot, to hurry us from the ≈øimplicity of unity, Chri≈øtian Charity and Faith, and is to be exploded the Congregation of the Faithfull.</p>
                     <p>Now to clear the Magi≈øtrates power as to his Tru≈øt in, and concerning both Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the matter is plain; the Offices of Magi≈øtrate and Mini≈øter are di≈øtinct; as a Magi≈øtrate, he cannot intermeddle with the Mini≈øterial proper Duties, but with the Mini≈øter he may, if he neglect his duty; and that is no more then that the Mini≈øter by his Office is not freed from Civil Judicature; And ≈øo, though with <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>zziah</hi> he cannot Mini≈øterially di≈øpence the Ordinances; yet he may and ought to ≈øee the Mini≈øter do his duty; this is according to the Law of God, and of this he may be judge;</p>
                     <p>That is, he may con≈øult, and puni≈øh, and ≈øo inforce<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> (and both the≈øe Offices may be in one per≈øon.) I ≈øhall not enlarge concerning this any further, but now proceed in the orderly ≈øetling of the Commonwealth by due and nece≈ø≈øary Admini≈øtration of Laws for Civil peace.</p>
                     <p>But before I come to particulars, I mu≈øt a little generally enlarge my ≈øelf concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power of the Magi≈øtrate, and his duty, that is, that the Magi≈øtrate hath all power, and is to execute all power in all things of what nature ≈øoever, conducing to the ≈øafety of the Commonwealth; and therefore that in ≈øome ca≈øes con≈øcience cannot be pleaded, but notwith≈øtanding all ≈øuch pleas, due puni≈øhment ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</p>
                     <p>To give Examples of Murther, and Adultery, Ince≈øt, and the like, will be plain.</p>
                     <p>But for Concubinage, and the true Polygamy, or many wives at once will be difficult with many men.</p>
                     <p>Yet the≈øe ≈øure, if made general, being but the re≈øtraining of the natural appetite, and mo≈øt con≈øonant to the hinted Doctrine of our Saviour in tho≈øe words, It was for hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of heart onely that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> allowed it, it was not ≈øo from the beginning, God created them male and female: The Magi≈øtrate may ju≈øtly and lawfully improve his ju≈øt Authority; but to extend it to death, as hath been u≈øed, was a≈ø≈øuredly not ≈øo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viou≈øly warrantable.</p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:105181:89"/>
                     <p>But to embroyl a Nation in War and blood, or lay a foundation to it for not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in the manner of exerci≈øing the Ordinances of the Go≈øpel, that cannot be allowed.</p>
                     <p>Such as marrying with a Ring; at the Table with a Communion, to receive it ≈øitting or kneeling, to admini≈øter it in the morning or at night, with a Surplice or white gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with all the like, that it mu≈øt be done onely in the publike Place of publike Wor≈øhip, ≈øo called Church; and this to prevent Here≈øies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Surely it is natural to each man to believe his own opinion right, and that he is edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in, the natural man without further controver≈øie allows; however he practi≈øes clean contrary.</p>
                     <p>Now it is certain, being all born in ≈øin, and under wrath, there mu≈øt be a work of God upon the Spirit before we under≈øtand the things of God; this God doth ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily by Preaching, Reading, Praying, Conferring, Meditating; ≈øometimes by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions with the≈øe; ≈øometimes by an extraordinary accident, as delivery from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected danger, or ≈øeeing ≈øome great judgement, or ≈øudden plague in and upon other men; a thou≈øand wayes there are whereby God preaches to a man.</p>
                     <p>Now accordingly as the Spirit is affected, ≈øo u≈øually is the man zealous or remi≈øs; and a≈ø≈øuredly in ≈øuch changes God is ≈øeen and glorified mo≈øt, as are from very bad to very good, as <hi>Paul</hi> from a Per≈øecutor to become u Preacher; and here the world takes mo≈øt offence.</p>
                     <p>It is true, the Angel of the Church is not to ≈øuffer the woman <hi>Jezabel,</hi> nor the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> to take root in the Church of God, but to labour with the Sword of the Spirit (not with fire and faggot) to reprove, exhort, admoni≈øh, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade, convince; and the Magi≈øtrates ought to exhort the Congregations to their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that men ≈øo qualified be ordained Elders in all the Churches, and that they do dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and faithfully improve the gifts given them, to the edification and peace of the the Church, and the gifts cea≈øing, to ≈øee others appointed in their places.</p>
                     <p>And the Pa≈øtors are to ≈øee the di≈øobedient, and perver≈øly refractory to be ejected their Societies.</p>
                     <p>And the Magi≈øtrate may approve the Rule of the Congregation, that no other Congregation receive them ejected, without ≈øatisfaction to them who ejected, fir≈øt given.</p>
                     <p>So that if you take the exhortative, inforcing the ju≈øt duty of Chri≈øtians, from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians in the Chri≈øtian Magi≈øtrate to be the keeper of the fir≈øt Table, he may be ≈øo called.</p>
                     <p>But if you take it for the per≈øon properly cho≈øen by God, to maintain, a≈ø≈øert, and defend the truth of his Service; the Magi≈øtrate hath a ≈øhare in it as a Chri≈øtian, if he be ≈øuch, and the Pa≈øtors the like; a ≈øpecial ≈øhare, in regard of their more immediate tru≈øts; but this keeping of the fir≈øt Table, is a Right belonging in my opinion to the whole body of Chri≈øtians, and every member may claim his due.</p>
                     <p>The Magi≈øtrates, even while pretending to it, have been the greate≈øt oppugners of it; witne≈øs the per≈øecuting Chri≈øtian ≈øo called, Kings and Princes in the Church, the ≈øo called Clergy drawing in the ≈øame cord; witne≈øs the cruel Ma≈ø≈øacres and Per≈øecutions the Pope and Bi≈øhops have rai≈øed for the ≈øame pretences; and all we believe again≈øt the Truth; ≈øo that it is manife≈øt the≈øe did not keep it; who then kept it?</p>
                     <p>But they who had no Magi≈øtrate among them, and ≈øeldome a Mini≈øter ≈øo called to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruct them; yet were the rite of Gods Service kept by them as by the ≈øeven thou≈øand in <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> when King, Bi≈øhop, Prie≈øt, and all wor≈øhipped <hi>Baal.</hi> I now ha≈øten to the Settlement intended; wherein I ≈øhall begin with Education of children.</p>

                     <head>How Children are to be Educated by Magi≈øtrates Authority.</head>
                     <p>THe Lord God took care for the meat or nutriment of ≈øpecial children, even in the Womb;</p>
                     <p>But ordered every Mother to give her own child ≈øuck, pre≈øuppo≈øing that riches and honor were but ≈øub≈øervient to Natures ends; but this ≈øtrictne≈øs now accounted, though the Magi≈øtrate might exact it where it could be, or puni≈øh its neglect,</p>
                     <p>Yet a≈ø≈øuredly to inforce it in this our Age, were to debilitate and enervate the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for our rich people are generally ≈øo luxurious, that if the weakne≈øs of the decaied ≈øtifled generative vertue choaked with exce≈øs, were not opened again to operate more acutely through another kind of nutriment in the poor Nur≈øe, they would all prove Changlings to old <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Valour, though in ≈øuch a ≈øoul the ≈øplendors of Chri≈øtianity may be as excellent, as in the ≈øtronge≈øt, faire≈øt and healthie≈øt con≈øtitution.</p>
                     <p>This I hint onely to intimate, at lea≈øt to Profe≈ø≈øors, what a duty is upon them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs the≈øe exce≈ø≈øes, which are ≈øo ruinous to Nature, and ought to be puni≈øhed; Natural men have out-gone mo≈øt Modern Chri≈øtians in the≈øe vertues.</p>
                     <p>My aim is at the manner, not ≈øo much of educating babes, or ≈øo called children, as youth; that is, from ≈øeven years to eighteeen at lea≈øt, if not one and twenty, or better five and twenty.</p>
                     <p>Now to this end, I ≈øuppo≈øe, that it is the duty of the Magi≈øtrate to Erect and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize, at lea≈øt, in the head-Town of every County Schools of Vertue, that is, fitted with Ma≈øters to teach and in≈øtruct the youth, according to their Ages and Capacities, in Arts and Arms; I mean by Arts, Trades of all ≈øorts and learning of all ≈øorts, atcord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Rule; This provided, that it is not intended, that all children ≈øhould contiue meerly learners till five and twenty; and it is ≈øuppo≈øed that the pre≈øent values, rents, and profits, of, and belonging to Inns of Court and Chancery, Univer≈øities, and Schools, will ≈øerve for this work; however ≈øo far that the defect may ea≈øily be ≈øupplied.</p>
                     <p>But that they ≈øhould not be accounted men till that age, nor to manage their own affairs, much le≈øs of the Commonwealth, but be under Guardian≈øhip.</p>
                     <p>And by Arms, I mean all the exerci≈øes of the body, whereby ≈øtrength and agility ≈øhall be increa≈øed, courage rai≈øed, and yet being under a Tutor obedience nouri≈øhed, and Prudence e≈øtabli≈øhed; for the≈øe Academies or Schools, it is requi≈øite to have their Rules grave and ≈øtrict, but not ridiculous, not ≈øuch as flat Caps after ≈øo long di≈øu≈øed, nor Cappings of ≈øo called Fellows as was in Colledges though the rain pour down, but to order ≈øuch due re≈øpect as breeds an aw with love, wherein there mu≈øt be nece≈ø≈øary ≈øeverity, not rigid peevi≈øh Tyranny; the aw mu≈øt expre≈øs it ≈øelf in a due ≈øilence, as well as active diligence; for the expence of ≈øpirits is great in clamorous, nay talkative youth; and ≈øure, would quick and ripe wits not vent ≈øo fa≈øt, their ≈øtore would la≈øt longer; this makes many pregnant young men to be old dotards.</p>
                     <p>Let the≈øe have di≈øcreet Vi≈øitors, or Superintendents, who once every moneth ≈øhall come and view the progre≈ø≈øes of the ≈øeveral years, and a penalty ≈øet, and that ≈øeriou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; this due training of youth will enable them to rule in ≈øea≈øon; the want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing due obedience in Education renders mo≈øt men unfit to govern; by this means the natural abilities of all men will be tried, and the vertuous eyed as fit for high imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the care of Parents will be quieted, while their children are ≈øo nigh, as once in a week they may ea≈øily hear of their health and ≈øickne≈øs; and the nighne≈øs to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents will aw the child from ≈øuch extravagancies as youth is ≈øubject to at all times, but mo≈øt when they are far from them, whom Nature teaches to fear by degrees.</p>
                     <p>The habits of the≈øe Students I inforce not that they be all alike, but that none be trimmed with Velvet, Lace, Points, Ribonds, or ≈øuch fooleries; none to wear long Hair, Rings, Scarfes, Fringes, Ro≈øes, Weapon or Boots; and that due and civil re≈øpects be ob≈øerved among them≈øelves, according to their degrees; but no fancies of Cu≈øtom to be allowed, as Salting, Mu≈øtarding, or any ≈øuch lightne≈ø≈øes, nor any trials of Wit or Strength, but in the pre≈øence of a Ma≈øter.</p>
                     <p>Thus ≈øhall both poor and rich be fitted to the ≈øervice of the Commonwealth, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs will be bani≈øhed, and ignorance de≈øpi≈øed; for all that were capable ≈øhould to the≈øe Schools for a time, till di≈ømi≈ø≈øed to Trades, for nece≈ø≈øary living by the Vi≈øitors or Superintendents; for prayers among them early and late, it is nece≈ø≈øary; but let
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:105181:90"/> the hours be apportioned for Study and Exerci≈øe, and let each day be Catachi≈øtical to the knowledge of Chri≈øtian Doctrine, as Moral or Civil conver≈øation.</p>
                     <p>But you mu≈øt admit no Colledge-School, or Academy, to have any Priviledges of ≈øeparate Juri≈ødiction, as now or formerly, they are but the inciters to Debauchery and Riot, with great emulation and di≈øturbance of the Peace; The Magi≈øtrate mu≈øt command; Let no door be free from the knock of the Con≈øuls Ax, it will make ≈øome heady one or other at ≈øome time or other to lay the foundations of chu≈øing Tribunes of the people.</p>
                     <p>Let onely their obedience to the Law be their priviledge and ≈øecurity; onely let the Tutors be free from per≈øonal ≈øervice in War, or other ≈øervice in Peace; but for payments, let them be charged upon him according to his Rate.</p>
                     <p>Let the books of Learning be publikely appointed by the Magi≈øtrate, not at the Tutors will; let not all be inforced to Latin, but each to Read and Write in ≈øome mea≈øure; Let times of ri≈øing be ≈øet down, and al≈øo going to bed, and ≈øome certain times wherein the children may recreate, but by parcels not all at once, which now is ca≈øe of great confu≈øion rudene≈øs and di≈øturbance.</p>
                     <p>Let the Ma≈øters interchangeably have times of re≈øpit for extraordinary occa≈øions; This will ≈øpeedily give a large increa≈øe for knowledge, which will make that your Magi≈øtrates in all places may be men of knowledge, which will embelli≈øh the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; whereas now mo≈øt Cities, Towns, yea I may ≈øay Counties are de≈øpi≈øed in Government for default of prudent knowing men: A long Robe-man or two guide all, and in this Age of intere≈øt, and the≈øe mens intere≈øts ≈øo vi≈øible as afore≈øaid, all is let run to confu≈øion.</p>
                     <p>And by this will al≈øo the ≈øeveral Congregations be fitted with able knowing Pa≈øtors, and Teachers; yea hone≈øt vertuous emulation in ingenuous ≈øpirits, will render almo≈øt every Member a Doctor.</p>
                     <p>This is ≈øeemingly a matter of great charge; therefore before I proceed, I will ≈øee how charges are to be born, rai≈øed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the relief of Commonwealths in exce≈ø≈øive burthens of people.</p>

                     <head>How all the Charges of the Commonwealth, Fees, and Fines, &amp;c. are to be A≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed and rai≈øed, and by what Rule.</head>
                     <head>And the wayes to ea≈øe Nations when grown over-numerous.</head>
                     <p>I Know that many will ≈øay this is good in Speculation, but the Practi≈øe is difficult, yea ≈øome will ≈øay impo≈ø≈øible; for you cannot get all men of one mind to it; others that it is again≈øt Priviledge to inforce children from the Parents Tuition, who being Guardians by Nature, the Law will not, may not, admit any Rule to bar his Right?</p>
                     <p>Others, This is a matter requiring great and va≈øt expence, and how ≈øhall it be rai≈øed.</p>
                     <p>To the fir≈øt I an≈øwer; If the Magi≈øtrate hath power to make the Law, then duty ought to ≈øubject all minds to unity in obedience.</p>
                     <p>To the ≈øecond I an≈øwer, That this is ≈øo far from di≈øpriviledging, that it is the highe≈øt, yea the top ≈øtone of Liberty; I dare not ≈øay it is not po≈ø≈øible to abu≈øe or mi≈øu≈øe this power; but if rightly u≈øed, it is the extent of Priviledge; for may a Magi≈øtrate make a Law to keep mad mens children, to educate Ideots, Lunaticks, and the like, and di≈øpo≈øe their goods, to the nece≈ø≈øary u≈øe of their Family, which all Laws of Nature and Nations allow?</p>
                     <p>Who art thou then Quaerie≈øt? if thou do≈øt it thy ≈øelf, thou wilt grant that mu≈øt be by allowed means and lawful wayes.</p>
                     <p>I ≈øay not That there cannot be ju≈øt cau≈øes of Negation, but I ≈øay Submit to ju≈øt things in their Sea≈øons, it is your duty; and deny unju≈øt ones when time of trial comes, that is your duty al≈øo. This takes not away your Guardian≈øhip of Nature, but makes your load lighter, e≈øpecially when and where it is greate≈øt; for the mo≈øt poor and ignorant are mo≈øt like to brable and wrangle ≈øuch intendments; for the charge, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs its great; but the great Lett will be, if you ≈øettle this aright, the rich mu≈øt pay for the education of the poor, and the barren of them that have children.</p>
                     <p>For I can allow nothing of a Rate but by an equal pound Rate, and that on all the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105181:91"/> e≈øtates of all per≈øons, and that not onely for Wars but for the poor; for maintenance of Mini≈øters, yea for Bridges, Cau≈øywayes, Highwayes, all publike Meeting-places, and that both for Divine and Civil affairs; if you ≈øettle it no higher then Counties at fir≈øt, it may do ≈øomething; but in a young or begun State, it is requi≈øite to ca≈øt all into a lump; were Righteou≈øne≈øs obvious in the di≈øpo≈øers, it would ea≈øily be a≈ø≈øented to.</p>
                     <p>But now the fear is, and Objections are, if you do thus, the Parliament men will look to di≈øtribution of parts mo≈øt unequally; and they that are be≈øt friended ≈øhall have the be≈øt proportion, though they have lea≈øt need.</p>
                     <p>As now in general Leavies, The Towns and Counties are mo≈øt free or burthened, as they have active Parliament men, Committee men and Ju≈øtices of the Peace to ≈øtand by them.</p>
                     <p>Therefore fir≈øt it is requi≈øite that each man ≈øhew forth integrity in his actions, ca≈øt away ≈øelfi≈øhne≈øs; own in deeds what you profe≈øs; be not deceived, God cannot be mocked; The Heathens at the preaching of Je≈øus, yea the Wi≈øe men, they that u≈øed curious Arts, brought their Books of great price and burnt them; come and do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe with your advantageous intere≈øts of all ≈øorts; you are all a Nation without ≈øcruple, though no National Church. But you object further:</p>
                     <p>This Nation hath lo≈øt its Politike Rule, it is over≈øpread with multitudes of men, nay multitudes of poor; ≈øo that to take care for the educating of all the≈øe, is, you ≈øay, wholly unfeazable.</p>
                     <p>To this I ≈øay, That no Nation, if not plagued with War or Di≈øea≈øes, but naturally it will grow over-numerous.</p>
                     <p>Now the Magi≈øtrate Supream ought truly to know the contents of his Territory, and be as able to lay out the po≈ø≈øible ≈øub≈øi≈øtance of his Subjects, as the wi≈øe Gra≈øier, to know how many bea≈øts will be depa≈øtured in ≈øuch a ground, or how much ≈øeed will ≈øow one Acre.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe are the My≈øteries of wi≈øe Regiments, which few Princes or Magi≈øtrates now adayes, if at any time will ≈øtudy, but it is their duty; for from not well con≈øidering the≈øe things, Nations which might in ordinary cour≈øe live quiet, being grown over populous, whereby the due care of inferior Magi≈øtrates is ob≈øtructed, they grow loo≈øe and lazy, then ≈øwarve into crimes;</p>
                     <p>Then complain of neglects of duty of Magi≈øtrates which is evident; then intere≈øt gains head, the≈øe make parties, and then the Sate is either embroiled or altered.</p>
                     <p>Therefore if the Princes will in the u≈øe of the wi≈ødom God hath given them to Rule by, Rule well and ≈øafely, they mu≈øt once every ≈øeven years number their people; if the Accidents, I mu≈øt ≈øo call them, of Plague, War, Famine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath not done it; and either by opening a fit way publikely known of ea≈øing their Counties burthen, by ≈øetling them in an other County; or if all Counties be full, by tran≈øporting them into an other Country avoid this danger.</p>
                     <p>This Act of Numeration well u≈øed, will take off the jealou≈øie to what end ≈øuch matters tend, and the well and carefully providing for the Colonies will encourage Adventurers; This will enlarge a Nation infinitely; and if well carried on, will by ju≈øt means ≈øo ≈øettle Chri≈øtian intere≈øt, that great, if not univer≈øal, will be the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Go≈øpel.</p>
                     <p>Now we ≈øend away Rogues; then you may ≈øend away Preachers, Teachers, Scholars, Ma≈øters of Prudence, in re≈øpect of Chri≈øtian and Civil know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                     <p>This fitted, you ≈øee vi≈øibly your charge cannot be ≈øo in≈øupportable; you look at the Commonwealths corruptions, as now wholly ≈øick, wholly defiled, this frights you; but let your ≈øpeculations mount higher; it is not <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>topiani≈øme,</hi> it is Chri≈øtian wi≈øe order; all you that look for Chri≈øts Raign upon earth, labor after it.</p>
                     <p>I bid you not ≈øit down by this, this is rational, yours is divine, this may be, it hath been, yours may and is to be prayed and attended for patiently; and if it heightens you in the active part of more exemplary conver≈øation, who will oppo≈øe it, let him fir≈øt live above you, and then teach you, not upbraid your opinion.</p>
                     <p>But ≈øurely all the Taxes, Charges, Levies, Payments ought all to be ≈øet, a≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, and paid according to one ≈øet Rate; ≈øo that each poor hone≈øt Countrey man may imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately re≈øolve his payment, and in ca≈øe of Refu≈øal, the Officer may know how to leavy it, namely by di≈øtre≈øs; and all to have one time, and till that time be pa≈øt, the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:105181:91"/> Magi≈øtrate ought not to i≈ø≈øue out his Warrant, and then upon a Warrant the Magi≈øtrate ≈øuperior to be ≈øued, not the Officer for levying it; for no rea≈øon he ≈øhould be que≈øtioned or mole≈øted (much le≈øs undone as now) for executing the commands of his Superior; for it is agreed the inferiour Officer in legal Admini≈øtration ought, and ≈øo may act, not que≈øtion; otherwi≈øe each Officer might delay; and therefore it is ju≈øtly con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, if he denyes and takes upon him≈øelf the knowledge of the Law; if he mi≈øtakes he is highly finable; and his Fine, and all other Fines, and the Fees, and Salaries belonging to all publick Officers, ought to be ≈øo A≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed and leavied, &amp;c. And where no di≈øtre≈øs is apparent, that is, no goods in the hou≈øe, be they who≈øe they will, or denyal, and they either delay or by denyal, impri≈øonment till payment, if able to pay.</p>
                     <p>I mu≈øt in this ca≈øe al≈øo remember, That it is fit that no per≈øon as no place be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchi≈øed from payments; for if one may be, all may be, except onely as nece≈ø≈øity enforces, and then to endure no longer then the time: Kings and Officers have made great advantage of the≈øe unju≈øtices, to the in≈øupportable dammage of the Nation, and ought ≈øpeedily to be rectified; and all Grants, Charters, U≈øages, and Cu≈øtomes to that end to be void.</p>
                     <p>So have ≈øome Lords of Mannors, holding originally of the Crown, as it is called, as of the Dutchy of <hi>Lanca≈øter,</hi> got ≈øuch priviledges as they are called, which ought not to be, nor may by ju≈øt Law; for that ≈øuch priviledges are di≈øpriviledges to the whole Community, opening a door to inju≈øtice and irregularity, and con≈øequently to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; for all may be freed from charges, taxes, ≈øervices, and the like, as well as one; And to ≈øay it is to be pre≈øumed the Supream Magi≈øtrate will not do it, is vain; they have abu≈øed them≈øelves, and many ≈øubjects much, who have paid largely for≈øuch grants; and after the Princes have been forced to plead they were mi≈øtaken in their Grants, and the poor men have been left remedile≈øs, for their purcha≈øe money.</p>
                     <p>In the la≈øt place it is fit that all vi≈øible per≈øonal e≈øtates be rated as they appear; and people vi≈øibly rich in Apparel, Hou≈øe, Hou≈øhold-≈øtuff, Dyet, &amp;c. be e≈øteemed as they e≈øteem them≈øelves.</p>
                     <p>Now the end of all Fines ought to be the defraying of the publick Charges of the Nation, City, or County, and the Offices there re≈øpectively; and to make the≈øe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by compo≈øition, mu≈øt be as experience hath manife≈øted the inlet to greater corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and abu≈øes; and though other Ages having ≈øeen the evils of the old way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition-evil, de≈øerted that, and therefore gave Fees at large, pre≈øuming they would take their ≈øalary, and fees be≈øides; yet it is manife≈øt it was the evil of bad men; for the other is the be≈øt Law; and puni≈øh ≈øtrictly, and fear not, you ≈øhall have Ju≈øtice exact.</p>

                     <p>But this being either ob≈øolete in it ≈øelf, or made ≈øo, or both (and really the Lord Chri≈øts words intimate no ≈øeparation, except only for Adultery; and that expo≈øition is the foundation to many as they ≈øuppo≈øe ju≈øtly not to make Adultery death; for if ≈øo, what needed divorce, but this is omitted here) and we proceed.</p>
                     <p>Let us ≈øee what is the Law of the Go≈øpel; truly it teacheth a duty and obedience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what the rudiments of the world enable unto: Our Common Law ≈øeems to me in ≈øomething too divine as I may ≈øay; As for example, it will not admit what we evidently ≈øee (<hi>viz.</hi>) that a man cannot rule his wife; there are women which will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Law again≈øt the will of the Husband; and indeed it is vi≈øibly not in his power to help; they will not only ≈øell and give his goods, but break, ≈øpoyle, mi≈ø-≈øpend, &amp;c. They will ≈øome beat the Husband, ≈øome cruelly mi≈ø-u≈øe the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:105181:92"/> children, &amp;c. and no way to puni≈øh them, but the good man is an≈øwerable for all.</p>
                     <p>I know the wretchedne≈øs of many men, but there is a little weak Law again≈øt them; Let us al≈øo have ≈øome Law publick for the women with that tenderne≈øs is fitting to conjugal Societies; but there mu≈øt be an aw in ≈øome one or more Magi≈øtrates, even to bridle ≈øuch exorbitances and neglects on either ≈øide, and make due a provi≈øion in all ca≈øes, and that wi≈øely and ≈øpeedily; or Divorces (indeed as u≈øual) will be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, and from thence Fornications and Adulteries clande≈øtine and private, make what Laws you can, though a legal divorce may be waved.</p>
                     <p>Next as to children, there is no due aw and re≈øpect of or in ≈øome, nay many Parents; the duty of the ≈øen≈øe of education is wholly lo≈øt; there is nothing but rude and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant loo≈øne≈øs; not only Parents cur≈øe Children, or provide not duly for them; but Children the Parents; and for want of a head Rule, no que≈øtion is made more of this then violences in any other relations.</p>
                     <p>Now in ca≈øe of ≈øuch Rule, it is fit to proceed by a more particular Law; for if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right knowing zealous Judges be not, there is no right; therefore it is fit to make the≈øe Laws Oeconomical more particular then others.</p>
                     <p>Again, as to Parents neglecting the due provi≈øion for their family, the Magi≈øtrate is wholly beaten out of it; The rule ought to be, that the Magi≈øtrate might take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance, what a man can earn if imployed; next that he and his be ≈øet on work; and thirdly, that he doth not, nor ≈øhall mi≈øpend it, but that the hou≈øe-rent and all be carefully di≈øcharged; and then where labour fayles, to be ≈øupplyed by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Pur≈øe.</p>
                     <p>Next for ≈øervants, not each one that will to entertain ≈øervants, unle≈øs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibly able to maintaine and imploy them; for otherwi≈øe there will be many ≈øluts and more Thieves, with multitudes of Receivers, which the Law can take no notice of.</p>
                     <p>This Law mu≈øt extend to all ≈øorts of ≈øervants which have not e≈øtates to maintain them≈øelves vi≈øibly; otherwi≈øe there will be from the neglect in one, a vi≈øible carele≈øne≈øs towards all.</p>
                     <p>Let no ≈øervant under a penalty be hired, but with a publike inrolment in the Town or Precinct Pari≈øhional, or otherwayes; however neither di≈ømi≈ø≈øed, or to go into another Precinct without Licen≈øe of an Officer in Writing; this is the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at pre≈øent; onely carele≈øne≈øs of Magi≈øtrates admitted pride to grow too fa≈øt in ≈øervants, and then all was omitted, and this is a main inlet to Confu≈øion.</p>
                     <p>It is al≈øo fit ≈øtrictly, by a ≈øworn Officer, to keep the Records of the Birth of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for the Age is now gro≈øly mi≈øtaken, and no a≈øcertained way of probation, with a ≈ømall fee, as a groat to the State to pay the Officer for enrolment, ≈øo much for ≈øearch, ≈øo much a Certificate.</p>
                     <p>For that of Strangers, it is to ≈øettle a little better the power, not only of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter of the Family in general, but particularly of tho≈øe who either by profe≈ø≈øion, are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, or others like them, upon other accidental occa≈øions, who now are by ≈øome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons made ≈øervants to their Lu≈øts, and have no power to bridle exorbitancy that they can know; for to ≈øpeak once for all, it is not enough ≈øome wi≈øe learned book-man knows all the≈øe Laws, or if all the ≈øo called Lawyers did; the Chri≈øtian Law mu≈øt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and per≈øpicuou≈øly hold forth to every man his certain known and a≈ø≈øured duty and power in their re≈øpective places; or the guilt, be it blood or otherwi≈øe, I fear lies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecially, if not wholly, at the Supream Magi≈øtrates door.</p>

                     <head>VVhether the Magi≈øtrate may appoint the Ages of Marriage?</head>
                     <head>And to whom the work of the Marriage belongs properly?</head>
                     <p>THe Government of the Family being ≈øetled, let us ≈øee how they part out of the Family; and that is commonly by Marriage; It is agreed, the parents did at their own Liberties di≈øpo≈øe their children; by natural rea≈øon (corrupted I conceive) they again≈øt Nature expo≈øed their children, not onely to the next hand of man that took it up by a ≈øetled place for that purpo≈øe, where they that had not the ble≈ø≈øing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of their own bodies, might take them off others hand that had many, which hath rea≈øon in it, and undenyable; but their expo≈øings were to meer fortune, as they called it, that is, let the will of the Gods be done, let the Bea≈øts devour it, hunger or cold or both ≈øtarve it, or the merciful hand ≈øu≈øtain it and nouri≈øh it; but the≈øe are wholly rejected with us; the way is to ≈øu≈øtain them till fit for labour or Marriage.</p>
                     <p>Now that of labor is generally hinted before, none may be brought up idle.</p>
                     <p>Now for Marriage, there is much to be ≈øaid; The general plea is, the Magi≈øtrate hath no power to ≈øet an age for Marriage; The rea≈øon is generally, that there are divers times wherein Nature works with men and women; and to pre≈øcribe one certain rule for all, is unfit.</p>
                     <p>Next, it is the Parents duty to take care of that.</p>
                     <p>La≈øtly, the gift of Continencie is of God, and not of man; and the Magi≈øtrate hath no power; the fir≈øt and la≈øt I ≈øhall couple together, and an≈øwer them thus.</p>
                     <p>It is truth, divers men and women are of divers tempers and Con≈øtitutions, and therefore one time will not agree to all; but ≈øurely the matter is not whether all men or women ≈øhall marry at one age, but that there is a duty upon the Magi≈øtrate to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve the vigour of the Nation by ≈øea≈øonable Marriages; doth it not much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us to breed a generation of men fit to manage bea≈øts, then to breed bea≈øts fit for management?</p>
                     <p>This natural ≈øimilar rea≈øon is of ≈øome force; ≈øurely there is too much loo≈øene≈øs in this our Law, to allow Copulation at twelve in the woman, and fourteen in the man.</p>
                     <p>Now the di≈øqui≈øition of the other part concerning the gift of Continency will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolve the whole; for I pray you how is the Law of Liberty and Continency to be pleaded? may the Child marry without the good liking of the Parent? Can the Child plead to him that he hath not the gift of Continencie? or do we rather know it is the loo≈øne≈øse of Government, the evil of idle unclean education both in young men and Maids, that inflames affections? The young ones are ignorant of what is ≈øin, and the elde≈øt often, and they fall into contagious offences each with other, before they under≈øtand the rules of wi≈øe Rea≈øon, being led away of natural appetite; and not with≈øtanding all incentives, the father is allowed to di≈ø≈øent from the Marriage of his ≈øon or daughter; and in ca≈øe of di≈øobedience, to cha≈øti≈øe with ≈øtroaks or di≈øinheri≈øon, or both, the ≈øon; and it is done to the daughter; But ≈øhould the ≈øon that had ≈øtoln the daughter bring an Action, or the married ≈øon, could he ju≈øtifie, or not, by the Law?</p>
                     <p>I profe≈øs the ca≈øe is difficult; for if lawful, why beaten? if not lawful, why may not the Magi≈øtrate ≈øet the rule of re≈øtraint to Naturall appetite as well as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent? the publick as the private Magi≈øtrate? for by paternal power and Juri≈ødiction he enforces.</p>
                     <p>Now the Chri≈øtian Magi≈øtrate therefore upon the whole may and ought to bridle this bea≈øt in man by a di≈øcreet Moderate Law, to re≈øtrain the Lu≈øts of proud, rich, lazy, idle, and ≈øo lu≈øtfull young ones;</p>
                     <p>And take of the itch of mean ones, by work, and labor of the body and minde, or both, with ≈ølender dyet, and holy exerci≈øes, Divine and Spiritual breathings after
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:105181:93"/> God, in the ≈øen≈øe of our own weakne≈øs, will as well re≈øtrain exorbitant affections in Chri≈øtians, as the love of Philo≈øophy, or the fear of the gods, ≈øo called, could Heathens; Let us not therefore eat to lu≈øt and live in idlene≈øs, and then we mu≈øt marry, O we burn.</p>
                     <p>It is as lawful from that rea≈øon to have many wives, many husbands, or diver≈øity of men, or women, in the accidents of ≈øickne≈øs, long journeys, and the like of yoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellows.</p>
                     <p>The Modern Age is wholly loo≈øe, through pretence of Chri≈øtian Liberty; that is the undoing de≈øtructive principle; and it ≈øeems by many who out of zeal again≈øt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wandrings, go about to eclip≈øe the glimp≈øes of divine inlightenments, to be fit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to be rejected; but both mu≈øt ≈øtand: a ju≈øt Liberty with a due re≈øtraint, that Ju≈øtice with Righteou≈øne≈øs be in all.</p>
                     <p>Now as it is rational, that the publick Magi≈øtrate may temper the liberty of the child, not to marry till a ≈øea≈øon; ≈øo after that ≈øea≈øon to mitigate the Rigidity of the parent is as nece≈ø≈øary, many parents being extream and cruel, forcing them to marry whom and how they plea≈øe, or not admitting Marriage at all.</p>
                     <p>I know the difficulty of the≈øe bu≈øine≈ø≈øes hath di≈øcouraged, but Chri≈øtian piety ought to advance endeavors in this kind, yea in ≈øome ca≈øes to portion moderately children dutiful and obedient in all other things, and permit them their own choyces, if nothing can be objected on the parents part but meer will.</p>
                     <p>It is al≈øo fit to re≈øolve the degrees of Marriage; for late Liberty hath made Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries concerning a ju≈øt and Regular Law.</p>
                     <p>And to ≈øee all this done, the Magi≈øtrate is the onely fit man.</p>
                     <p>The Act is meerly civil; it is old Popery acknowledging Marriage a Sacrament, that onely continues it in the Clergie ≈øo called; Therefore let no Marriage be ≈øolemnized, but before one or more publick Magi≈øtrates thereto appointed, inrolled or recorded in a book of purpo≈øe, with their hands, and of the Parent, if living, or Certificate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hand and Seal of the Magi≈øtrate where the parties live; otherwi≈øe of the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, unle≈øs they be of ≈øuch an Age as is fixed by the Magi≈øtrate, or they be married by Magi≈øterial Authority, that is, though the Parent before refu≈øe, having no ju≈øt cau≈øe; alwayes re≈øolved, that if a Magi≈øtrate offends, or Ra≈øures be and alterations, that the puni≈øhments be exceeding high.</p>

                     <p>Fir≈øt from open war; ≈øecondly, from private force; thirdly, from deceit or fraud; and la≈øtly, from difficulty: Let us a little di≈øcour≈øe therefore of war; and whether Chri≈øtians may war?</p>
                     <p>Surely, the Church, that is the Congregation of Saints are militant on earth; but that oppo≈øition being again≈øt ≈øpiritual enemies, Satan, lu≈øt, pomps, vanities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not the ≈øubject of our di≈øcour≈øe; again≈øt the≈øe there is no Quaere; they mu≈øt war; and the≈øe are enemies both outward and inward; and though the children of God will not, cannot war among them≈øelves, yet there are fal≈øe brethren, ≈øuch as go out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they were never in; Heretiks ≈øo called, Deceivers, Lyars, and all ≈øuch as are ca≈øt out of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Now for the≈øe I ≈øtill humbly conceive, that we mu≈øt look at the nature of the offence; for if it be meerly mental, opinative, and internal from the ≈øouls mi≈øtakings, but not degenerating in actual ≈øcandal; the weapons that are to be u≈øed again≈øt the≈øe, are meerly ≈øpiritual, which are mighty to the beating down of all the ≈øtrong holds of ≈øin, and overthrowing every thing that is not of God; and again≈øt ≈øuch, I ≈øuppo≈øe no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward force, yea though you ≈øuppo≈øe or beleeve them firmly to be Hereticks, may or ought to be u≈øed, ≈øo as they di≈øturb not the Civil Peace.</p>
                     <p>But a ca≈øe will enlighten ≈øomewhat; Suppo≈øe one doth beleeve, as many are ≈øaid to do, the aboli≈øhing of the Sabboth, may the Magi≈øtrate enforce obedience?</p>
                     <p>To this I ≈øay, that he that holds the aboli≈øhing of the Sabboth, held a Sabboth was and then mu≈øt acknowledge the power whereby that Sabboth was, and ≈øo the end to which it was directed, which was the ea≈øe of the creature from corporal labor, and for his edification in the ≈øervice of God in the Spirit; This gives no loo≈øe to any Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundrie that day, no Sporting, no nor idle Tatling, Walkings, but the Spirits Recreations in the Contemplations of Divinity ought to be the repa≈øts of the Soule.</p>
                     <p>Then a≈ø≈øuredly the Magi≈øtrate may hinder this, and cau≈øe keeping within doors, and puni≈øh offenders; Therefore let not the Gates of a City be opened that day, but to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105181:94"/> ≈øuch as pa≈øs too and fro, and are known, and that to partake in divine and ≈øpiritual ≈øervices, and that not above a Sabbath dayes journey; and agree that, but dilate not twelve moneths what is a Sabboth dayes journey; but within the private Family there is no inforcing of the Magi≈øtrate; that is, he ≈øeems not to be bound to it, nor is his power evident.</p>
                     <p>No, the better way to know the care and diligence of the Ma≈øter of the Family, is, to appoint ≈øome men, not as Church Officers, but Civil Inqui≈øitors of Knowledge, who may ≈øee the progre≈øs in Knowledge of ≈øuch as are out of the Schools and Colledges, and puni≈øh, or cau≈øe them to be puni≈øhed at fir≈øt; and afterwards the Parents and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters; and not to admit to places of Magi≈øtracy, ≈øuch as are ignorant them≈øelves; ≈øo neither tho≈øe that do not carefully educate and in≈øtruct their Family, whereby they may in their ≈øea≈øon become ≈øerviceable in the Congregation of the faithful.</p>
                     <p>Now this war of Hereticks and profane per≈øons being over; let us ≈øee what is to be done to tho≈øe without the Church.</p>
                     <p>I ≈øay to the≈øe, That the≈øe al≈øo as the Religion wherein they were educated, are to be permitted their Con≈øcience without force; ≈øuppo≈øe them Papi≈øts, and ≈øuppo≈øe them Idolators, ≈øuppo≈øe them Turks, and ≈øuppo≈øe them Heathens; for unle≈øs by the pure light of Nature they mu≈øt or may ≈øee it, that is, it be evident and per≈øpicuous; I take it, Rea≈øon, Divine or Humane, corrects not, notwith≈øtanding that Parable of the Servant that knew not his Ma≈øters Will and was to be beaten.</p>
                     <p>Now this is evident; for among all the cla≈øhings among≈øt opinions untill now, where was it not, that every one ≈øtrove onely to free them≈øelves from the power of others to be inforced, yet would inforce others? but now I take it to be the infinite Mercy of the Lord to reveal this thing unto us that ≈øee it, how many do not; that is they can ≈øee nothing but confu≈øion accompany it.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the other part of Papi≈øtry, though claimed as part of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Pope is Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and may di≈øpo≈øe Kingdoms, di≈ø≈øolve Leagues, Oathes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit obedience to powers, and that becau≈øe he hath ≈øaid it, there is no faith to be kept with Hereticks: All or any of the≈øe being contrary to the peace and ≈øafety of a State, may be enforcedly renounced, and the parties denying ju≈øtly bani≈øhed; I ≈øay not their goods confi≈øcate; for we know many do con≈øcienciou≈øly hold the≈øe things, and with great ≈øtrength of Natural Rea≈øon, as much as maintains the greate≈øt pretending opinion in this Age, and now in conte≈øt with us; And in ca≈øe of Re≈øi≈øtance War is lawful.</p>
                     <p>So that in brief I take it, War is lawful again≈øt the Enemies of the Church, Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with Spiritual weapons, again≈øt the carnal enemies with corporal weapons of Bani≈øhment in ca≈øe of de≈øtructive errors to peace and civil quiet; and warlike force, where the State and Nation cannot otherwi≈øe in Prudence ≈øecure it ≈øelf for the entring the others Country or Limits.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, To make that the Seate of the war, where other things are clear, the Law of Nations which admit it, will well ≈øetle it.</p>

                     <head>How the Militia ought to be ≈øetled.</head>
                     <p>ALL Humane Laws have their ≈øettlements, and of them≈øelves naturally devolve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Error; ≈øo that if we eye all the wi≈øe ≈øettlements of Nations in this or ought el≈øe, it is nought worth now: The <hi>Jewi≈øh, Romane, Grecian, Egyptian,</hi> or other old or Modern; the foundation yet of mo≈øt of the≈øe, being originally Regal and ab≈øolute, held one cour≈øe to engage, as our <hi>William</hi> ≈øo called the Conqueror did the great men to an ab≈øolute dependance upon him, and by them to va≈ø≈øalize the re≈øidue.</p>
                     <p>I know many godly hone≈øt people ≈øee no ≈øuch thing; I believe it, God gives gifts va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou≈øly; but mo≈øt certain it is ≈øuch dependancies are the Nur≈øes of Feuds and Jealou≈øies; If therefore you will ≈øetle the <hi>Militia</hi> aright, you mu≈øt ≈øuppo≈øe your Nation or Juri≈ødiction at terms of Unity among them≈øelves, under no great and eminent civil broyl; for then none on the adver≈øe party to them in power, or ju≈øtly ≈øu≈øpected, that is openly oppo≈øing (by pur≈øe or per≈øon) can be for a time entru≈øted; but otherwi≈øe the power muff be in the dependance in the Supream Magi≈øtrate, and their active power by his general Law.</p>
                     <p>That is, That all within their Limit, from twenty ≈øix, or twenty eight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ≈øixty, ≈øeventy, or <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be chargeable to the War; that is to ≈øay, They that have not e≈øtate to ≈øuch a value, to be in inferior ≈øervices, as Pyoners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And of this let the inferior Magi≈øtrate take the ordering care.</p>
                     <p>Next, All that are of ≈øuch an e≈øtate, to be charged Foot-Arms: All of ≈øuch an e≈øtate Hor≈øe-Arms, that is, Dragoons, and Light-hor≈øe, as the e≈øtate is.</p>
                     <p>Now as to this, and to all Rates, it mu≈øt be known that there will be multitudes of Quaeries ari≈øing; ≈øome have great e≈øtates fit in proportion to find ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred Hor≈øe; ≈øome in re≈øpect of great and va≈øt real, others va≈øt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonal e≈øtates; ≈øome have their lands lie altogether; ≈øome di≈øper≈øed; ≈øome live in their own, ≈øome in Cities; ≈øome have great charges of children, poor friends, and decayed, ≈øome in debt, and ≈øome have granted out Annuities, Rents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and have outwardly a fair vi≈øible e≈øtate, bur indeed and really ≈ømall.</p>
                     <p>Now in all the≈øe there ought to be a Rule of proportion with ≈øafety to the whole; for fir≈øt, it mu≈øt be agreed, that the Commonwealth con≈øi≈øts of real and per≈øonal e≈øtate; the real e≈øtate Hou≈øe and Lands, the per≈øonal e≈øtate Goods and Money.</p>
                     <p>Now this is certain, that all Land mu≈øt have ≈øtock, all Trades mu≈øt have ≈øtock, it is vi≈øible; therefore the rule of Charges of all ≈øorts mu≈øt be the Land and the Stock, and that whether in City or Country.</p>
                     <p>Now for di≈øcharge of this, it mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity be either theirs who≈øe vi≈øibly it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be, or others.</p>
                     <p>For Lands, in which there is ≈øo much more then Turki≈øh Knavery, if it were inrowled wi≈øely and ju≈øtly, it would prevent much; but due puni≈øhment would take it all away, while impunity breeds offences, that controver≈øie, that gain to the Officer; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cried up ≈øo.</p>
                     <p>This Land, and this Stock is the ≈øub≈øi≈øtence of the Nation; I know Corruption fears di≈øcovery of e≈øtate; for either they are rich, and would conceal it, or poor, and fear undoing: Now to nouri≈øh either of the≈øe corrupt intere≈øts, is de≈øtructive; the la≈øt is mo≈øt to be eyed, but lea≈øt to be regarded; for though ≈øome good come of it, yet it is the mo≈øt dangerous; for from hence comes all the ≈øtock of Bankquerupts, and the ≈øudden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings of many e≈øteemed rich men; and indeed it is mo≈øt unchri≈øtian and utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for a man knowing him≈øelf poor to borrow or buy at a day for what he vi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and certainly ≈øees not he can pay, though ≈øuch may have thriven.</p>
                     <p>Thefore allow no di≈øcharge, either for rates of A≈ø≈øe≈øsment of Moneys or Arms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the vi≈øible e≈øtate, but with certain knowledge of the owner; onely this is fit, that for A≈ø≈øe≈øsments for the vi≈øible per≈øonal e≈øtate abatement be <hi>per</hi> rate as for land by the hirer (all the Objections are an≈øwered before as to per≈øonal e≈øtate;) and for real, let it be charged as it lies in the Counties.</p>
                     <p>I ≈øay not in the Towns; it is be≈øt leave that at the di≈øcretion of the Commi≈ø≈øioners, or Judges for Arms, unle≈øs a general ≈øettlement by a ≈øtanding National Law be; only let ≈øuch rents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as are going out bear a proportionate charge of hor≈øe or foot re≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, as the ≈øaid Judges ≈øhall under Hand and Seal appoint and Record in their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter-Book.</p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:105181:95"/>
                     <p>For to ≈øay it once for all; all the≈øe Juri≈ødictions ought to be ≈øetled, and to be the Records of the County.</p>
                     <p>Now I pre≈øume you will not find a better way for the pre≈øent ≈øettlement, then the owner to be at the charge of the Hor≈øe and Arms, the Tenant to find the keeping of it, labouring him rea≈øonably, ≈øo as alwayes to be ready for ≈øervice; and if he dyes not by negligence, but ≈øickne≈øs, or in Military ≈øervice, the owner to find another, otherwi≈øe the Tenant, and the Training ≈øervice by the Tenant al≈øo; for all ≈øervice more then for meer Trayning ≈øervice, ought to be the expence and publick charge of the County at lea≈øt, if not National, which is more ju≈øt; then one County ≈øhall not bear all the burthen of war and charge al≈øo, as is too frequent; and for price of hor≈øe, le≈øt the owner and Tenant differ, let a ≈øet price be ≈øo much for a Dragoon, ≈øo much a hor≈øe of ≈øervice, and this price to be ≈øet yearly at ≈øuch a day.</p>
                     <p>But finding in divers places where the lands lie, will ea≈øe ≈øome part of the ju≈øt doubt of the great mens over-powring the County by pur≈øe and power, but nothing will avoid it wholly, except it be enacted, that no one man find above 6, 8, 10, &amp;c. hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes or Arms; and that for every one that he is in proportion of e≈øtate chargeable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that number, let him pay ≈øo much yearly as ≈øhall be ≈øetled to the publick pur≈øe, or for the ea≈øe of ≈øome particular ≈øervice; but better all to come to the publick pur≈øe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the County, or of the Nation.</p>
                     <p>Next, all Arms are to be owned the Nations or Publicks, yet to be in the hands of the particular per≈øons charged, unle≈øs di≈øpriviledged. Next, the≈øe Arms mu≈øt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in War by fit men, and even to Chri≈øtians it may be ≈øo requi≈øite (if it be not ≈øimply unlawful) to admini≈øter a Military Oath of obedience to the Officer, according to the Tenor of the Commi≈ø≈øion of the Officer, or General, of faithfulne≈øs in his tru≈øt; for though ju≈øt men and vertuous are true for hone≈øty ≈øake, yet the evil will not, but the fear and con≈øcience of an oath will reach far with the wor≈øt of men; And ≈øo to the Souldier re≈øpectively.</p>
                     <p>Let this, and the rea≈øon of the di≈øu≈øe be well Quaeried.</p>
                     <p>Some pre≈øume the be≈øt way of ≈øettlement is to charge ≈øo many Arms only upon the Town≈øhip, whether hor≈øe or foot, or labourers in the wayes or carriages, and all to bear their equal proportion; now this generally may be good, but the particular rule wil vary every moment; either or any of the wayes may do, ≈øo the Commi≈ø≈øioners as they are Judges, do ju≈øtly; for all Laws as Governments are not ≈øo much good or bad by In≈øtitution, as by Execution; to this end it is fit as mo≈øt think, to give a general Oath of faithfulne≈øs in their tru≈øts, although they agree it true, that the generalty of men are ju≈øt for Righteou≈øne≈øs ≈øake, oath or no oath, they are the ≈øame; And ≈øo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; but in a Commonweal, in the State that <hi>England</hi> is now in, it is fit to make Laws of this nature, probationers for a time in each County, and by due returns of what is done (which is ≈øo required, but neglected, for that in all things its noted only from all Acts and Ordinances, and In≈øtructions earne≈øtly required for a day or two, and then rejected, which is a great over≈øight in them ≈øupreamly concerned; for it is vi≈øible, all men are by this beaten out of the road of ≈øetled obedience, and ≈øpin out time to attend the i≈ø≈øue; and that falling out as of old, they will never be forward to ≈øervice after; ≈øo for ≈øervice in Arms, the forward appear, the other ≈ølack; ≈øo in A≈ø≈øe≈øments upon the true value, the forward pay to the utmo≈øt peny, the other half, no puni≈øhment but talking, no, deal gently; thus is all ≈øen≈øe of obedience to Powers and Authorities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed by the Powers them≈øelves, and their ≈øelf-ended Agents, ≈øeeking to make par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for one ≈øuch time and per≈øon-≈øerver ≈øhall in this corrupt Age have more followers then 20. hone≈øt men.) But I return to my task, If the ≈øupream Power have due returns, let them ≈øee and judge out of the ≈øeverall experiments made, what is fitte≈øt to be the general head Rule, and way of the charge of Arms; Its vi≈øible in our condition at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent, the generality of the Nation are unfit to be entru≈øted; but for accidental evils there can no particular remedie be well pre≈øcribed: the general Rule wi≈øely executed mu≈øt be the top ≈øtone under God of the ≈øafety. Magazines in the ≈øeveral Hundreds for the publick Arms of the Hundred, or the chief Town adjoyning, or ≈øuch head Town, or Town of defence in a County, to be the Magazine of the County: the≈øe have all their objections, yea in a ≈øetled ≈øtate, all or any may be u≈øeful, and in a di≈øtracted one may prove de≈øtructive: now the difficulty is but to find out the be≈øt as we mu≈øt ≈øay for the pre≈øent temper of the Nation: for its certainly true, to ≈øettle unity, love and peace,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105181:96"/> and root out the jealou≈øies and acerbities which are ri≈øen in a Nation; its fit to have all the ≈øame general Law; the Supream Magi≈øtrate ought ≈øo to admini≈øter Law, that it be the ≈øame to all his Subjects. To follow the crochets of Machivilian Politicians by tran≈øplanting ≈øouldiers, is to nouri≈øh ab≈øolute dependences, ≈øuch as free Common-wealths explode, &amp; only rai≈øe to an eminency of power to do good or evil at lu≈øt, which is tyrannical; no; a nece≈ø≈øary dependance is all here hinted, which though ≈øome may extend farther then others, yet while its rule is not ab≈øolute, nor its con≈øtant practice, there is no ju≈øt ground for exception; by this its plain, the Laws mu≈øt be equal, that is, re≈øpecting time, place, per≈øon, e≈øtate &amp;c. and ≈øo univer≈øal; now for the leading and conducting of the≈øe, whether to place the whole under a general Command, ab≈øolute and ≈øetled, of a known Military Officer, or of a Civil Officer, as now the Sheriff; and the other to be ≈øetled by the Supream power, as need is, is worthy enquiry, yet ea≈øie to be determined; for if it be looked into, both will be ≈øeen nece≈ø≈øary; for the ≈øetled Law of <hi>England</hi> alwaies allowed the power of the County to ≈øuppre≈øs Riots, &amp;c. and again≈øt ob≈øtinate offenders and oppugners of the Publick peace; therefore the chief Judges in the County mu≈øt have an Officer duly con≈øtituted, who ≈øhall ≈øee to the execution of the Laws; next to give the ancient Colonel or the Col. of Hor≈øe in each County the chief tru≈øt in order, re≈øerving ≈øpecial power of making an extraordinary Officer in chief, is (while Commi≈ø≈øioners for the Militia are a Court re≈øident) the mo≈øt (evidently) ≈øafe way. Now we are come to con≈øider a nece≈ø≈øary engagement, and that is the pay of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Souldiers of the Trained Souldiers of the Nation. To this its ea≈øily an≈øwered, if in actual ≈øervice pay is nece≈ø≈øary, the doubt is only in time of peace; now not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtingui≈øh of peace as ≈øetled peace, and di≈øturbed peace, intervalls of peace and war, or outbreakings or fears; I ≈øay in the mo≈øt ≈øetled times, its fit the Officer have ≈øome ≈øetled pay, be it more or le≈øs, as the Supream power thinks fit. I ≈øhall not enlarge concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that; what the age of Souldiers is, is not ≈øo needful; ours is the be≈øt way that requires an able man of body, and of this the Commi≈ø≈øioners are ab≈øolute Judges. Its not much requi≈øite with us what rank a Hor≈øman be of, e≈øpecially if the State be mixt Monarchy, ≈øo called, or Republical; for honours engage not to a dependance, that is, ≈øhould not but as the Law requires.</p>
                     <p>For offences done in the field, and as Souldiers, let them be tryed by the Commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øioners for the Militia, without any form of complaint legal or in writing, that is ≈øo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øitated, and let the Mar≈øhal ≈øee the Judgement executed.</p>
                     <p>For all things which now the Heralds exerci≈øe in Office, and which the Lord Mar≈øhal did take cognizance of, they ought properly to come to the Commi≈ø≈øioners thereto appointed in the County; and that for the Militia is the fitte≈øt; for Honours aro≈øe from Arms, and with them let the Records of Honors remain.</p>

                     <head>Whether Indictments or Appeals are to be pur≈øued in cau≈øe of crime, or both.</head>
                     <p>HAving done with the due regulation of Arms (which under <hi>God</hi> are the great ≈øtaies and ≈øupport of men, to a≈ø≈øure their peace, quiet, repo≈øe &amp; enjoyment of what <hi>God</hi> by their friends or labors hath vouch≈øafed them) for I mu≈øt agree that the foundation of humane happine≈ø≈øe ≈øub≈øi≈øts in the providence of the Almighty, however he u≈øeth us as in≈øtruments, that is, gives ≈øucce≈øs to our endeavors thereto. We come now to look at the civil ≈øettlement in the remainder; and fir≈øt becau≈øe the criminal part of law is of mo≈øt and greate≈øt concernment, as looking at the life of man, I ≈øhall therefore look fir≈øt at that; now in this the difficulties cau≈øing difference are the≈øe; in an appeal, there mu≈øt and ought to be witne≈øs be≈øides him that appeals; for he is the accu≈øer, and that either in his own right, or as next of kin, but all for private benefit. Secondly, there the dammages are to the party, and it is a per≈øonal thing proper to the complainer, and he may de≈øi≈øt when he will, and compound as he will. The Indictment is at the ≈øuit of the ≈øupream Magi≈øtrate, ≈øolely for the benefit of the Commonwealth, and the State hath all the goods, and all dammages; and the pro≈øecutor, or complainer, is here a witne≈øs for the State, but at his own charge, which is as now u≈øed, unju≈øt. The Intere≈øt therefore of the Magi≈øtrate &amp; the Subject ought here to be compromi≈øed rationally, for a≈ø≈øuredly, if life goes for life, dammages are cut off as unfit, or of unequal value to be rendred for the life of a man; therefore the heir, or wife, or friend who ≈øhould bring an appeal, as I conceive, ought to have no forfeiture; ≈øome recompence may be, where the life is lo≈øt, as in all ca≈øes of Murders and voluntary con≈øiderate killings, and in all appointed duels, not in heat of blood, e≈øpecially if for ought the Law gives a remedy (for great abu≈øes di≈øpuni≈øhable by Law, it ≈øeems not rea≈øonable) but of this more after.</p>
                     <p>Now for to clear this, indeed it is requi≈øite that there be, as is ju≈øtly ≈øuppo≈øed in Law, an Attorney for the State, whether called Clerk of the Crown, Clerk of the Peace, or what other name you will give him, ≈øetled in every County, who upon a ≈øet day each week, by vertue of his place, ≈øhould receive all complaints, and that upon oath, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf being duly ≈øworn, and then by and with the con≈øent and advice of one or more Ju≈øtices, ≈øhould frame an appeal generally, thus: I do challenge you <hi>A.</hi> for the peace of the Commonwealth, to an≈øwer to <hi>B.</hi> for the death, wounding, &amp;c. of <hi>C.</hi> whereof you are accu≈øed; and let <hi>B.</hi> and another witne≈øs make two witne≈ø≈øes; and upon the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him guilty, let him be fined moderately, that is, ≈øo that at lea≈øt a fourth part of his e≈øtate be left him; The like Law al≈øo in ca≈øe of Maym, wounding, &amp;c. whereof two parts to the party wounded, &amp;c. a third part to the State to bear all charges (for it is not fit to add charge &amp; lo≈øs of time to him that is before oppre≈ø≈øed) in ca≈øe of life, let life an≈øwer
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:105181:97"/> life, unle≈øs by mi≈øadventure, yet then he mu≈øt be fined, but not to the party, but to the State, and that but to a third part of his e≈øtate reall or per≈øonal, to bear charges; and where the life is lo≈øt, the charges mu≈øt al≈øo be apportioned in like manner. For the leavying this, the way is before ≈øet: but for di≈øcovery of e≈øtate, there is the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; but in Lands admit no tru≈øts for deceit, nor u≈øes to cheat, and the e≈øtate in the Land will be vi≈øible: and take the goods in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion at the time of death, and all is ≈øatisfied that can be expected.</p>
                     <p>Only let a ≈øet time be for Creditors to come and be ≈øatisfied; al≈øo that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth be ≈øatisfied, and the members not ruined, undone, and impoveri≈øhed: Thus ≈øhall both intere≈øts be ≈øatisfied, and the multitudes of legal quarrels by indictments, &amp;c. will be quitted, which have freed many rich Murderers, Poy≈øoners, &amp;c. and of other offendors multitudes, when there have been poor pro≈øecutors. That this mu≈øt be done in the County where the fact is committed, is owned; Let the transferring him from one County to another, when taken out of that County, be ≈øetled in an ea≈øie and ≈øpeedy way; and that a Judge be there ready to determine ≈øuch ca≈øes, weekly, if not daily: however to examine witne≈ø≈øes immediately upon Oath, (which all Ju≈øtices mu≈øt have power to give as they ≈øee cau≈øe; therefore make wi≈øe and hone≈øt Ju≈øtices better then yet are) and let this be taken as evidence, as far as is credible, and let not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øes ≈øtay a moneth, a quarter, a year for Tryal, and at unrea≈øonable charge: and as ≈øoon as gone, a Tryal; if ≈øtay, a flaw in the Indictment, though the Evidence be plain.</p>
                     <p>This was <hi>Englands</hi> old Law; and the rea≈øons are the ≈øame; the alteration was the ≈øweet benefit, not Ju≈øtice or Righteou≈øne≈øs: Why cannot the Ju≈øtices in Ordinary in the County, try Felons, Murders and Trea≈øons, as well by a ≈øetled Commi≈ø≈øion as a Special one: And in all faults, the condition of the fault, and the quality of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon ought to be ob≈øerved. In an Amerciament, or Fine, I would have but one word for all pur≈øe-pains; for that is ju≈øt, and is our Liberty of old, and now ought to be.</p>
                     <p>For Murderers of them≈øelves, and Murders and Man≈ølaughters by unknown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, let ≈øuch rule be as is proportionate for Fines, to deterr, not ruine Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and enquiry in all by one ≈øpecially appointed, as with us <hi>per</hi> Coroner; but let his power and Fee be certain, that he encroach not on the Office of the Ju≈øtice, who is but Inqui≈øitor; yet it might be better to give every Ju≈øtice that power. For Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dands, let the Law be ≈øetled by ≈øome Rule of proportion, which our Law books hold not forth but ≈øolely for the advantage of the Crown ≈øo called; yet under the Right of God as the Prie≈øts portion, this ≈øeems wholly ≈øuper≈øtitious.</p>
                     <p>For words threatening life, let good Sureties be for the peace; and let due pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and evidently hearty confe≈ø≈øion of his unchri≈øtian walking be before remi≈ø≈øion. This will quiet all double Controver≈øies. For of ≈øuing fir≈øt an Appeal and then an an Indictment, fir≈øt Indictment, and then action, brings that there is no end of labour.</p>

                     <head>How Debts are to be Recovered.</head>
                     <p>HAving briefly pa≈ø≈øed the≈øe Heads, I come now, before I come to treate of the way and manner of Trials particularly by twelve men, to treate of the Civil Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy as diver≈øe from Criminal, and look at that as it looketh at Liberty, Goods, and good Name.</p>
                     <p>And in this I ≈øhall pa≈øs over the Introductions to Debts, which are Trading, Bargaining, Selling, Giving, Granting, Bequeathing, and the like, and the con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences thereof; now as to this all Revenge is but be≈øtial, Satisfaction is Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
                     <p>Now the ≈øatisfaction mu≈øt be either from Lands or Goods; Lands for the benefit of Po≈øterity ought to be pre≈øerved as much as may be; therefore till there appear no Goods, there ought to be no Proce≈øs again≈øt Lands; but as the evil pre≈øent is alwayes heavie≈øt, ≈øo the liberty of the Parent is to be e≈øteemed above the future advantage of the i≈ø≈øue, and then the lands are to be ≈øold.</p>
                     <p>Our Law holds forth things ju≈øt enough; I cannot in my con≈øcience but ≈øay the fault is principally in the Practi≈øer and the Judge; the one to move unju≈øt things, the other to determine them; although I believe many of the Errors were brought in upon Prudential grounds, rather then Legal, or to avoid the rigidity of the Letter originally.</p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:105181:98"/>
                     <p>For thus it ≈øtands, the Law being thus anciently, that fir≈øt Goods, then Lands, then Liberty was to be ≈øei≈øed for debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon a ju≈øt and proportionate Rule, nece≈ø≈øity found wayes to evade: Quaere the Goods, and they were others; Quaere the Lands, and they were aliened; and to run through the difficulties of all the≈øe Trials, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then was found too great, and therefore the Law of impri≈øonment at fir≈øt by Atre≈øt was brought in; That it is again≈øt Priviledge, that is as u≈øed, I believe it highly; but that it is again≈øt Priviledge duly u≈øed, is not to be deemed.</p>
                     <p>We ought in all things to remember we are Chri≈øtians; our profe≈ø≈øing well, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øing ill, makes bad Chri≈øtians, nay meer civil ones Athei≈øts, and keeps good Heathens from Conver≈øion; Surely now, we by our Laws make ≈øuch multitudes of poor, that we ≈øee no way to relieve them, and therefore we exact not the Law of common di≈øtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Ju≈øtice; I dare not be too bitter; The Lord write upon the hearts of Magi≈øtrates ≈øuch (let me ≈øay Chri≈øtian) affections, that the poor may be rightly maintained; but that is not my task here, therefore I proceed.</p>
                     <p>If any Debtor be, let the Creditor come to a legal Officer appointed, and there Avow in the word of a Chri≈øtian, that ≈øuch a one is truly indebted to him in ≈øo much, and ≈øhew particularly how; if the publike Officer knows the man re≈øpon≈øal, let the Debtor be immediatly ≈øummoned to an≈øwer to the Creditor for ≈øo much, be it by Bill, Bond, Book, Promi≈øe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the Officer knows not the Creditor, then let the party be ≈øummoned, and if he denies the debt, then let one legal Witne≈øs (for all men are not to be admitted Witne≈ø≈øes) Avow; by that I mean a Prote≈øtation in the name of a Chri≈øtian as before a Magi≈øtrate, that he knows the thing; then if the party ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies not the debt by a day, let a Plea be entered.</p>
                     <p>No more but thus; <hi>A.</hi> of ≈øuch a place, impleads <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>C.</hi> for ten pounds which he ows him upon a Bond or Bill, or as the matter is.</p>
                     <p>Then let the Debtor an≈øwer thus; <hi>B.</hi> to the complaint of <hi>A.</hi> for the debt of ten pounds, denies the debt, promi≈øe, Bond, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or pleads ≈øo much paid, and tenders the re≈øidue, with ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to the Order of the Court.</p>
                     <p>If he appears not, let an other ≈øummons go by way of exacting the party or parties to appear under the penalty of the value of the debt; if he appear not, nor any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torny for him being warned, let the goods be immediately ≈øei≈øed and inventoried by one ≈øworn man or more, and apprized by ≈øworn men, as they are truly worth, then to be bought at the fir≈øt hand, to the utmo≈øt of their knowledge; and let one Ju≈øtice of the Peace admini≈øter the Oath, to appear equally and indifferently between Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Debtors; then let a Jury of twelve or ≈øix men, ≈øuch as ≈øhall be lawfully called of the next neighbours, capable of the great tru≈øt of ≈øuch Judgement, ≈øufficiently qualified with e≈øtate to recompence, knowledge to di≈øcern, and faithfulne≈øs to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge, for ≈øuch ought all Juries to be, and then the Trial by Juries is excellent, where the matter needs, or will bear the delay, except you ≈øhall ≈øo enforce obedience, that Trials may be ≈øpeeded as called; then the debt proved, let not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be till all Creditors be called in, and then let their debts al≈øo be proved, not allowing above forty dayes for all, and then let the goods be divided into three parts, if there be no other e≈øtate; otherwi≈øe three parts of the whole be di≈øtributed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionately as the re≈øpective debts amount, a third part ≈øaved to the Creditor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the ≈øame Trial that ≈øettles the goods, let it pa≈øs the lands, and let the Sei≈øure of the Land and Sale be by the publike Magi≈øtrate, but all enrowled in a Book for that purpo≈øe.</p>

                     <p>SUrely the old way of State and Sei≈øin ≈øo called in the ≈øimplicity of that Age was good; but to ≈øpeak it once for all, it is the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the great priviledge of Free men, that they may make Laws according to nece≈ø≈øity.</p>
                     <p>I write not this to de≈øtroy, but enlarge the Subjects Priviledge, who now by the practike part of Law are deprived of the ju≈øt end of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and all el≈øe. I know there is a conceited humerous generation, that are content with nothing but the Letter of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and others as much again≈øt it; I ≈øhall equally walk equally between them; It was then a good boundary to the Prerogatives of Princes, and power of Judges; and it were better to follow that truly now, then to be again ingulphed in as va≈øt an Ocean as no Law, in the variety, multiplicity, and difficulty of Laws; for how many things, literally ob≈øerved, would plainly much prejudice the Commonwealth; but I proceed.</p>
                     <p>Lands then in ca≈øe of doubt mu≈øt receive a Trial, as for other matters of value, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a publike Judge, the cour≈øe by a ≈øhort complaint, at a day ≈øet for both parties, with their Witne≈ø≈øes pre≈øent, who can prove the matter in que≈øtion, or upon Oath made that they are ≈øick, or ≈øuch Ca≈øe as is allowed upon Oath taken before a Ju≈øtice of Peace; the <hi>Affidavit</hi> of ≈øuch per≈øons may be read, atte≈øted under the Ju≈øtices Hand and Seal.</p>
                     <p>Alwayes provided the <hi>Affidavit</hi> without another ≈øpecial Witne≈øs doth nothing; and in Ca≈øe that the land be adjudged to the complainant, to be immediately awarded, and delivered within three dayes, under the penalty of a Fine Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble value (for the time it is holden above three dayes) to the rent for half a year: For obedience in Civils mu≈øt be rendred to mi≈øtaken judgements, final or primary; if final, for ever; if primary, till death of the party, unle≈øs he lives ten or twenty years; for it is fit to ≈øet a time after ≈øuch judgements, that ≈øo it may be fit for a Purcha≈øer, who may otherwi≈øe pay his money, and lo≈øe his land; if the Demandant or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainer be not able to make good his Title, let him pay the Fine for the charges of the Defendent, as is adjudged in open Court, and then let him be di≈ømi≈ø≈øed; which Fine mu≈øt be according to the nature of the offence, and the e≈øtate of the party, both being con≈øidered.</p>

                     <p>This al≈øo mu≈øt be pur≈øued, that no rule at Common Law, or Order ≈øo called in Court of Equity, but be Ingro≈ø≈øed, Read, and Signed by the Judge before going out of Court.</p>
                     <p>Now to ≈øome, there will ≈øome difficulties ari≈øe at fir≈øt; what needs this double work, may not one Court determine Equity al≈øo?

                     <p>Now to draw men to ≈øuch labours, there mu≈øt be ≈øome allurements; we had ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that of late years it drew all the prime wits and parts of the Nation that way, and all the Courts being at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> the whole Nation during the ≈øo called Terms, was void of requi≈øite Government; for the≈øe wits to maintain and encrea≈øe their honour and riches, had made the Law ≈øo difficult, that good hone≈øt Knights and Squires in the Counties, yea though they had ≈øtudied the Law, dur≈øt not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon a matter extraordinary; how then ≈øhould Citizens? and the≈øe, and the Attorneys, by the adjudges tricks and niceties, had buried Ju≈øtice pa≈øt finding out by Juries; each man had his legal quillet to deceive the hone≈øt man, prejudice the State, and yet ≈øatisfie his ≈øo called con≈øcience.</p>
                     <p>Now if pleaders be rightly u≈øed, then they are no more but men skilled in the Law, who are for the party who choo≈øes them for their Councel, that is, ≈øuch upon who≈øe judgement and skill in Law they will depend, to make good the Law for them to the Judge, to manage evidence, which ≈øome have been famou≈øly infamous for; to do what they can for the Clyent, that is by lawful or unlawful wayes to get the day, is mo≈øt unchri≈øtian.</p>

                     <p>SUrely the Almighty wi≈ødome appointed nothing in it ≈øelf but ju≈øt, and that ju≈øtly, yea above other Law-givers, who from want of prudence, oft multiplied ≈øervants to ≈øuch numbers as they oft oretopped their Ma≈øters and the Laws; but the Lord by allowing ≈øervitude among his people, yet limiting it for a time, gave ≈øatisfaction to ju≈øtice every way; the proprietor was ≈øatisfied by labor, where e≈øtate failed, and the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant had his day of freedom, and the danger of multitudes was never obnoxious to them; for we ≈øee the Lords and great men offended in forcing ≈øervice, but not the contrary; ≈øervice therefore well limited, is held by many and tho≈øe prudent men, and godly Chri≈øtians, no way di≈ø≈øonant to the Liberty, nay equality of the Go≈øpel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by Chri≈øt we are brethren, and fit to be practi≈øed as well as bound Apprentices, but with well tempered Laws.</p>

                     <p>This premi≈øed, U≈øury in it ≈øelf may be lawful, if not forbidden; now if it be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, let me ≈øee where it is; if it were Typical, it is aboli≈øhed; if judicial gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, it is rational, that is, all tho≈øe Laws hold forth the rea≈øon of commanding, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting plainly, and then let us ≈øee the rea≈øon.</p>
                     <p>Now if you take it judiciall ≈øpecially, as proper to the Jew, then it mu≈øt by like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon run thus, Take no u≈øe of thy Brother a Chri≈øtian; the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Tran≈ølation hath it poor Brother, which to me plainly hints the Law, and its rea≈øon, and that ju≈øtly; and this not ob≈øerved, is unchri≈øtian; ≈øo to impri≈øon for meer u≈øe, the principal received, much more all lo≈øt; and that not by neglect, folly, or exorbitancy; for all the≈øe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Ca≈øe in the Court of Chri≈øtian Con≈øcience; but for rich men to detain u≈øe is unju≈øt, or if able to pay, for to plead it while cloathed as Princes might be, is a ≈øhame to the Governours; God hath not bound us Chri≈øtians to Laws of meats, particular Judicials, wherein the command was onely to try obedience, therefore regulated; it is without que≈øtion as lawful as letting of Lands, much more lawful then buying for three pence in the ≈øea≈øon of the year, and for half a years benefit of laying out of the money, to get twelve-pence, fourteen-pence, which is ten fold, nay one hundred-fold wor≈øe u≈øury then twenty <hi>per cent.</hi> yet this is u≈øual and never ≈øtumbled at; but to double is counted lawful nece≈ø≈øary gain; how ever if the Law allows not, let it not wink; I now come upon the rule of like rea≈øon to Quaere,</p>

                     <p>PUblike and Univer≈øal con≈øent took away not onely the Tenure in <hi>Capite,</hi> which was originally the great mans dependence upon the King, and after great and ≈ømall being become every ones purcha≈øe while annexed to Lands, which was incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but al≈øo Knights Service, becau≈øe of the dependence of mean per≈øons upon Lords by Sword-Service; and the rather for the incidents now become ≈øo in≈øufferable, of Ward≈øhip, Marriage and Relief, and the prime rea≈øon effecting it next to the power which ≈øtruck the fir≈øt ≈øtroak, or nothing had been done, was the original ground of the In≈øtitution of the Tenure cea≈øed.</p>
                     <p>I need ≈øay no more for Coppyholds; a wi≈øe unintere≈øted man will ≈øpeedily conclude the rea≈øon of the in≈øtitution of the Tenure is gone.</p>
                     <p>Truly you Lords of Mannors, you it concerns, I pray con≈øider upon what grounds you hold Courts, ≈øwear men, Fine at plea≈øure, ≈øeize goods, or de≈øtrain; a cunning Lawyer might find you all in the forfeiture of all your Mannors: How many Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors have ≈øprung up ≈øince Prohibition? but this is but by the By; the State may look to ≈øuch Chequer Rents and forfeits in time; but to the thing it ≈øelf.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe dependences are vi≈øibly de≈øtructive to the peace, quiet, and purity of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Nation; next the forfeitures are unju≈øt, being con≈øtantly for no cau≈øe rea≈øonable; again the pro≈øecution or finding it is al≈øo unju≈øt, being by the ≈øo called Homage the Lords men; this abu≈øe is evident; Some Lords ≈øetting them≈øelves in Court, and threatning the Homage if but que≈øtioning the rea≈øons of the matter in que≈øtion, and make them find what they plea≈øe, yet ≈øworn.</p>
                     <p>La≈øtly, incertain Fines are wholly unju≈øt; and above all the dependences of Free men; for now Coppyholds is al≈øo become each mans purcha≈øe, yea Free mens; this is clear again≈øt the original Con≈øtitution; and the rea≈øon cea≈øing, the Law ought to cea≈øe; but if the intere≈øts of Lords prevail for the pre≈øent, that there be no totall abolition of the name, and remembrance of that Tenure, no more then of <hi>Capite</hi> and Knights Service, which is equally ju≈øt; yet let the Commonwealth have its due freedom, let the Fines be made certain, one years clear value, which cannot be above two parts in three.</p>
                     <p>Next, No forfeitures; next to pa≈øs by free deed; la≈øtly, all as Free-hold at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, except onely the Rent; for it is better enlarge the Rent and have no Fine.</p>

                     <p>HEretofore Deceits were not ≈øo frequent; men, yea even the highe≈øt preferred honor above inheritance; Now as the love of riches, the god of the world pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, ≈øo private intere≈øt grew, and from thence loo≈øene≈øs of Law; and the jealou≈øie between our Kings and people, made Laws come forth difficulty, and when ever they came, the intere≈øt of one ≈øide was vi≈øible, or the Law ≈øo choaked with ambiguities, or incertainties, or ≈øo ≈øhort in the main, that it did but add to Contention, be≈øides the difficulty of obtaining them, without an active leading Parliament man were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor or eager promoter, which in tho≈øe dayes few would or did undertake out of pure zeal; ≈øo that men ≈øet down willingly by the evil, and lookt to prevent it as well as they could, and take their chance, as they called it, among≈øt others, rather then ≈øtir for new Laws of any ≈øort.</p>
                     <p>This made of late years, the legal robberies of cheating and truly fraudulent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances encrea≈øe (as well as Letters) yet not within the adjudged remedy of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, frequent; for it is as ea≈øie to avoid the Statute as to quench ordinary fire with ≈øcalding hot water; one good Law again≈øt all frauds, is better then a hundred of the be≈øt again≈øt fraudulent conveyances; the rea≈øon is ≈øo gro≈øs and vi≈øible that it neds no pre≈øident, there are yet too many.</p>
                     <p>But while all po≈ø≈øible means of the exact purity of Ju≈øtice are to be indeavored by all Magi≈øtrates, e≈øpecially Chri≈øtian: It is ju≈øt and requi≈øite, that they take the hint of the good hath flown from the manner of pa≈ø≈øing of Coppyhold E≈øtates, which truly proves, that an Office of Inrollment, at lea≈øt in the Head-Town of every County, is of nece≈ø≈øity, with ≈øuch due regulations as is fit; and in the ≈øame Office, a pa≈ø≈øing of the wives con≈øent, by ≈øealing the Deed of Sale, or relea≈øing it; provided, the Act be done before two Ju≈øtices of the Peace, be as good as a Fine; the <hi>Dedimus</hi> upon the Fine, is to meaner per≈øons, le≈øs fit to be tru≈øted then ≈øome Ju≈øtices may be; however not under the con≈øcience of an Oath, which all they be; the charge of a Fine is not ≈øo much (though to ≈øome it is more then they are worth, and ought to hold ≈øome rule of proportion) as the trouble, care, delay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>ALL agree, that right is to be done; but many, nay mo≈øt differ about the way; and certainly there are divers wayes, and all good; but there are better wayes, and the be≈øt; but the diver≈øity of Opinions is great in the≈øe; for ≈øome call that be≈øt which others call but good: ≈øo various is Judgement, much more Opinion; for many which have found the good of one ju≈øt, wi≈øe, di≈øcerning Magi≈øtrate, will think him better then a Jury of Twelve; and they that have found corruption in one Magi≈øtrate, and Ju≈øtice from Twelve men, abhor what they call Prerogative Sentence; it mu≈øt be a≈ø≈øented to that while in the fle≈øh, the be≈øt men are ≈øubject to fails and mi≈øtakes, and therefore to drain Ju≈øtice hath been thought the be≈øt; this with popular jealou≈øie in the ju≈øt fears of dependencies of Judges rivited <hi>England</hi> to the maintenance of Juries, who will not ea≈øily forgo it; and though there is at pre≈øent ≈øo much mi≈øcarriage, that I think there is far more evil then good by them to the Nation, I would not their temporary ejection, but their due, ≈øtrict, and ≈øetled Regulation.</p>
                     <p>But fir≈øt, every Ca≈øe is not worth ≈øuch trouble; but Ju≈øtice mu≈øt be done in every Ca≈øe; and unle≈øs you will pay Juries for their pains, they cannot travel; therefore to avoid this, you mu≈øt make Judges in every Town; and though the letter of the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is general, yet do but the Ju≈øtice of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Subject will not complain.

                     <p>Let this alwayes be within twelve moneths after cau≈øe of Action. Then let a Summons go to the Defendant by a ≈øworn Officer from the Court, or the party, or ≈øome other making Oath of the Summons; if he appears not, let a Note be fixed to his door, (under a ≈øevere penalty to any one to take off) requiring appearance, or to ≈øhew Cau≈øe; if neither be done, let the Trial immediatly be awarded; if he appear, let the day of hearing be ordered and entered in the Court-book, (and that truly by the Clerk under a ≈øevere Fine, immediatly to be deducted by abatement in his Salary;) after which time, let a Jury of twelve or ≈øix men (for it is not the number that doth the work, I think ≈øix be≈øt; but that conte≈øt is not worth the while: the alteration of an old received way is the greate≈øt objection) be warned, not under the penalty of twenty, or one hundred pounds, and nothing ever paid, but of ten or five ≈øhillings, to be a≈ø≈øuredly levied to the States u≈øe immediatly of Cour≈øe, unle≈øs ≈øick in bed, or otherwi≈øe imployed in the Service of the Commonwealth in the County above twenty miles, or hindred by Providence; which Cau≈øes ≈øworn and allowed, may excu≈øe or e≈ø≈øoyn him; for not ≈øummoned, the Officer is ≈øworn, and mu≈øt admit no pre≈øent conte≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Now the men mu≈øt be knowing, under≈øtanding men, and of e≈øtate to an≈øwer dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, (if that be continued) if they give a fal≈øe Verdict, which is ju≈øt, being they are properly Judges of the dammage: now if they and the Judge differ upon the Law, let them do it at their peril; for the Ca≈øe, let it be ≈øtated, the Judges and their hands with the Coun≈øel pre≈øent ≈øet to it, and let the yearly Judges decide it; and if the Judge be faulty, let him, otherwi≈øe the Jury be fined to the State; and if they give a fal≈øe Verdict, that is, go not truly according to what is truly alledged and proved, unle≈øs they or ≈øome of them of their own knowledge know the thing of which they are bound to give the Court publike Cognizance; for Juries as other Judges are under a Rule of Rea≈øon and Common Ju≈øtice.</p>

                     <p>IF Jurors be to have knowledge and e≈øtate, and that in ≈øuch manner as may an≈øwer the Tru≈øt, then ≈øurely in ≈øome mea≈øure witne≈ø≈øes, upon who≈øe evidence the Jury is ≈øworn, to lay the foundation of their judgement ≈øo called Verdict, ought to be men fit to be beleeved; The Law principally looks fir≈øt at infamy, e≈øpecially perjury; but this being legal perjury, the puni≈øhment was ≈øo penal, and the Law ≈øo difficult, that few were complained of, fewer attainted.</p>
                     <p>Now this is ≈øure, moderate puni≈øhments, ≈øeverely executed, curb more then ≈øevere puni≈øhments remi≈øly or not at all. The Law in the next place lookt at Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for relations they are not valued in Law as to witne≈ø≈øes.</p>
                     <p>A≈ø≈øuredly he ought who is a legal witne≈øs to be of ≈øufficient under≈øtanding, next not convicted of notorious crime; for ju≈øtly what is the cau≈øe of rendring a man uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the benefit of the Law, or rejection of Church-Society, ought to be admitted if proved, a good plea again≈øt the witne≈øs; yet let ≈øuch a man ≈øpeak, but not upon oath; for he that obeyes not man for Gods ≈øake, nor God for his own, is not be allowed to call God to witne≈øs; for in his acts he denyes him, though with his mouth he owns him. If it be askt, Why heard?</p>
                     <p>Then I an≈øwer, he may ≈øpeak truth, but is unworthy that ≈øacred Te≈øtimony.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Magi≈øtrate mu≈øt from his words and probabilities and circum≈øtances, and ≈øo the Jury gather the truth of the matter; but where the man is capable of oath, let him be ≈øworn, whether 'twixt the State and Subject, or Subject and Subject; for right is the ≈øame.</p>
                     <p>There is al≈øo nece≈øsity to hear the wickede≈øt mans Te≈øtimony, though not ≈øwear him, becau≈øe we cannot alwayes chu≈øe witne≈ø≈øes; therefore e≈øtate is not requi≈øite, nor can be ≈øtood upon in witne≈ø≈øes, as in Jury-men, who are to be cho≈øen.</p>
                     <p>For point of favor; I find in this Age it is of great importance; for ≈øuch relations in Nature are generally preferred to, (though unworthily) relations either of Countrey or City, earth or heaven; few men leave all for Chri≈øt, Truth or Ju≈øtice ≈øake; Therefore I would admit the notice of alliance, but not the objection, and hardly carry it upon ≈øuch a ≈øingle Te≈øtimony.</p>

                     <p>Let therefore the Magi≈øtrate no longer count words light, while they bear the weight and price of blood, but repair every breach, give a ju≈øt recompence for every lo≈øs, and then puni≈øh tran≈øgre≈ø≈øors ≈øeverely in ≈øuch Ca≈øes; for many think they may ju≈øtly become their own avengers where thc Law affords no remedy.</p>
                     <p>The example is evident in ≈øtealing Dogs, ≈øo called for plea≈øure, which hath co≈øt Lives and Ears.</p>
                     <p>The Lord Mar≈øhall did take notice of ≈øome of the≈øe matters, but not all, and that with ≈øuch delay and difficulty, that the parties were better try it ≈øhortly; therefore for all words, give ≈øpeedy remedy; let the complaint come pre≈øently to the Judge, and receive a trial accordingly as the Supream Magi≈øtrate ≈øhall order.</p>
                     <p>For the ≈øecond part, which are difficulties, ≈øu≈øpitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we have no infallible word to warrant it; the practi≈øe aro≈øe rather from Heatheni≈øh Super≈øtition, then Chri≈øtian Faith; therefore we are to leave them to Gods judgement, and ≈øettle the matter ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øome other way, as of lot in Ca≈øe of doubts in civil claims, which a≈ø≈øuredly is lawful.</p>
                     <p>But as to the other ≈øu≈øpitions, there the cau≈øes of ≈øu≈øpition are to be examined, and if approved, they are either evident or doubtful; if evident they convict; if doubtful, they render ≈øu≈øpected.</p>
                     <p>Now in all Ca≈øes of ≈øuch Tendencies to ≈øu≈øpition, if the parties ≈øu≈øpected walk ≈øtill ≈øu≈øpectedly, they are to be puni≈øhed, but not to the height of puni≈øhment; and puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mu≈øt increa≈øe as crime does; but to entertain jealou≈øie too far is dangerous. Therefore let all Magi≈øtrates ≈øee ≈øome grounds before they admit Que≈øtion, more before they puni≈øh.</p>
                     <p>For the Ordeals, were they an infallible certain Rule, they might be u≈øed; but for want of that, they are unwarantably made Laws where ever u≈øed; and therefore where u≈øed, to be rejected.</p>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:105181:106"/> latitude to the Supream Power, but ≈øpecially exalting Chri≈øt and his Kingdom above all, yea though alledging the very words of the Pope, That no Chri≈øtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrate but mu≈øt be a Church-Member, and ≈øo inferior to the Church it ≈øelf, whereof he is a member; for the Officers, as he is a member, mu≈øt give him the Rule, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, yea though he were a Pa≈øtor or Elder him≈øelf.</p>
                     <p>I conceive this ≈øhort Tract, wherein ≈øo many particulars are briefly hinted, onely to draw them into di≈øcu≈ø≈øion, is not fit to open that controver≈øie, which mu≈øt be with much Wi≈ødom, Prudence, Judgement, and ability of divine Learning di≈øcu≈ø≈øed, or it will but cloud more, and tend to heighten the differences of intere≈øt twixt Church and State: I ≈øhall therefore (for the pre≈øent at lea≈øt) forbear to open that Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øie, and look onely at the Magi≈øtrates duty generally; for his power, I make it the Handmaide onely to his duty.</p>
                     <p>Religion therefore being the proper object of the ≈øpirit of the inward man, is not the proper ≈øubject for the Magi≈øtrate as a man, nor of his power, no not though a Chri≈øtian.</p>
                     <p>Yet while there are Hypocrites in the world, and the Notion of Religion may veil Trea≈øons and Obliquities to the State, being and well-being of the neighbour; it is the Magi≈øtrates duty to ≈øee to the≈øe, as before; but as to the particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of Chri≈øtians, in, and concerning, or Doctrine, or Di≈øcipline, it is not clear that the Magi≈øtrate hath ought to do in it, while the outward peace be not di≈øturbed thereby; I will exemplifie generally.</p>
                     <p>Suppo≈øe the Doctrinal Quaere be, How many Sacraments? Or whether Bapti≈øm came in lieu of Circumci≈øion, or di≈øcent from the particular ≈øeventh day as a Sabbboth, and the like.</p>
                     <p>We ≈øee plainly, that while the Magi≈øtrate u≈øed his power according to his opinion, as the Magi≈øtrate inclined, ≈øo matters went generally; and the oppo≈øites in opinion oft crucified each other, ≈øeldom converted.</p>
                     <p>Therefore a≈ø≈øuredly, in the≈øe difficulties of Faith among Chri≈øtians, let the Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Exhortations, Per≈øwa≈øions, Convincements of the Church be urged, let not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward force be u≈øed.</p>
                     <p>It is well known, the great cau≈øe of our Embroilments now, is the difference pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, betwixt tho≈øe of the Congregational way, and tho≈øe of the Pari≈øhional Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined way; I have purpo≈øely omitted this matter to this conclu≈øion of the Work, to ≈øumm up all; for it is plain, the Controver≈øie ≈øtands thus, as is hinted in the fir≈øt Part,</p>
                     <p>Whether the Churches are to be gathered anew?</p>
                     <p>Now to under≈øtand this fully, it is to be noted, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is counted Schi≈ømatical by <hi>Rome,</hi> renting from her, as ≈øuppo≈øing ≈øhe had ≈øo far parted from the Doctrine of Chri≈øt, as that there was no po≈ø≈øible ju≈øt Chri≈øtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with her, which the Puritan mu≈øt ≈øtill hold, that is, the true Pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter.</p>
                     <p>They all agree a Reformation nece≈ø≈øary.</p>
                     <p>But they of the Congregational way ≈øuppo≈øe it cannot be a Reformation, but ≈øuch as is a new Congregating; that is, they own indeed what the Puritan ≈øuppo≈øed; That truly ≈øuch was the Apo≈øtacy of <hi>Rome,</hi> that there is nothing to be done with her; they own her not the Spou≈øe of Chri≈øt, but a Harlot <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> her ≈øi≈øter in the old way.</p>
                     <p>And it is mo≈øt ≈øure, compare the Doctrine of Chri≈øtians, as to all ≈øorts of men and women, and all the actions of their lives; And a≈ø≈øuredly, the beginning of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Governments from the light of Nature, gave forth greater and more glorious examples of Piety, Ju≈øtice, Mercy, Fortitude, Truth, Charity, Love, and that to Enemies; Gratitude, Obedience to their Country, and to them ≈øet over them in any kind, and zeal for their gods; which I commend onely as far as it walked even pace with their profe≈ø≈øion, then there is to be found among Chri≈øtians, and among Princes where they devoted them≈øelves to their Country and people, as among the both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>We have ju≈øtly bani≈øhed Super≈øtition, and wickedly given free ≈øcope to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane≈øs; the lives of the be≈øt are ≈øo far≈øed with the rudiments of the fle≈øh, in eating,

                     </p>
                     <p>Now of all the≈øe a≈ø≈øuredly there is evident power in the Magi≈øtrate to repre≈øs them, whether in the exce≈ø≈øive vanity, in eating, drinking, cloathing or gameing; but tho≈øe more inward and heart vanities are to be repre≈ø≈øed by a general prudent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The example of tho≈øe in Authority, and power, and their due exerci≈øe of that power where needful, is the great incentive to excellent vertue.</p>
                     <p>Now the conte≈øt of the Presbyter for a puni≈øhing power, and his loo≈øne≈øs in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Members to his Church, makes the Eagle ≈øighted Magi≈øtrate jealous that what ever is acted by holy and religious men at fir≈øt faithfully, yet if holding forth a liberty of Contention for Supremacy, ≈øome will attempt in time to claim of duty, while there are Wolves which will for lucre and intere≈øt ≈øake put them≈øelves in Sheeps cloathing, as heretofore hath been evidenced. But this the Magi≈øtrate in the pre≈øent Age mu≈øt eye wi≈øely and ju≈øtly; that is, re≈øolving that the Lord Chri≈øt hath a Supremacy, which he mu≈øt be alwayes ready to acknowledge, and al≈øo to give unto him.</p>
                     <p>Now in ths conte≈øt for the con≈øtituting of Churches otherwi≈øe then as it gives ju≈øt cau≈øe of di≈øturbance to the peace of the Commonwealth, I ≈øee not that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrate hach ought to do; It is yet a matter of ≈øcruple to many good Chri≈øtians, what Church there is in <hi>England,</hi> for that the Church is con≈øtituted National.</p>
                     <p>I believe mo≈øt pretenders to Morality are a≈øhamed of it, plainly ≈øeeing, that it is not the Bapti≈øm of Water that makes a Chri≈øtian, but that of the Spirit; and the ≈øame delu≈øion works upon men to re≈øt upon Signs and Forms under the Go≈øpel as under the Law.</p>
                     <p>Yet the outward Church-fellow≈øhip, that is the fir≈øt ≈øo called ≈øign of a true Church being with them, that is the Sacraments, and that profitable Sacrament of a Prie≈øt to admini≈øter them, makes all within the Church, though there be no Officers, or them but meer Lay-men, ≈øo called Church Wardens, and Over-≈øeers; and of the≈øe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtences, and incongruities are our Pari≈øhes framed.</p>

                     <p>The rea≈øon of this Quaere is of principall concernment; for if ≈øuch there be, then a≈ø≈øuredly their work is extraordinary, and then a ≈øetled maintainance for extraordinary men will to mo≈øt judicious men ≈øeem incongruous, and if out of a ≈øetled place, more di≈ø≈øonant from the univer≈øall ingagement which by the mi≈ø≈øion apo≈øtolicall is upon tho≈øe endowed with ≈øuch a Spirit.</p>
                     <p>If there be no ≈øuch men, and that that ≈øpirit vi≈øibly is not exi≈øtent in ≈øuch men among us; Then the Quaere is by what Rule or upon what ground, Apo≈øtolical Succe≈ø≈øion is claimed without Apo≈øtolical Spirits.</p>
                     <p>And then upon what ground they become Teachers of the people. If it be ≈øaid from humane Learning, then the work is by ≈øome thought properly the ≈øubject, if not ≈øoly, of the Magi≈øtrates power, and cognizance.</p>
                     <p>If it be ≈øaid Divine purely, then it is an≈øwered before, and mu≈øt be proved either by the expre≈øs word, or working of the Spirit, or both; if mixt, that is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Divine and infallible word, but ≈øubject to a fallible con≈øtruction: Then we are in the round, for none will acknowledge their own opinion faulty.</p>
                     <p>By this it will appear that the particular Chri≈øtian is the keeper of the fir≈øt Table, for none of the≈øe are in the whole infallible, Popes, Councels, Bi≈øhops, Elders, Cla≈ø≈øes, Congregations, all erring, wandering, pleading infallibility and demon≈øtrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves fallible.</p>
                     <p>For the age and Qualifications of Pa≈øtors and Teachers, I altogether omit it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuming if the greater be ≈øetled, the le≈ø≈øer will al≈øo.</p>
                     <p>The Que≈øtion concerning the Admi≈ø≈øion of Infants to bapti≈øme I omit, with the ancient Rites of Bapti≈øme where the per≈øons baptized ≈øtood up and received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: And only ≈øay that if no Rule were originally given for baptizing in Fonts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of fountains, no nor practi≈øed in the mo≈øt flouri≈øhing times of the Church in all places Chri≈øtian, yet after commanded, then a≈ø≈øuredly if the Church hath that latitude in the form, take it only ≈øo of a Sacrament, There is not ≈øo much ami≈øs in Romes Ma≈øs as is ≈øuppo≈øed; and if the Church hath not that power, there is more ami≈øs even in the pure≈øt reformed Congregations then is yet di≈øcovered: And if ≈øo, then ≈øurely the Power of the Church mu≈øt re≈øt in di≈øpen≈øing duely the plain word for edification, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, confutation, reproof, or exerci≈øing the di≈øcipline in rejecting the ob≈øtinate and di≈øobedient.</p>

                     <p>This now will allow both Magi≈øtrates and Congregation a re≈øpective bound, whereby both Antichri≈øt Lay and Clerick may not domineer, to the di≈øturbing of Con≈øcience;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:105181:108"/> for if in in <hi>Pauls</hi> time one eat fle≈øh, another Herbs, one meat ≈øacrificed to idols, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not, ≈øome kept dayes, others not:</p>
                     <p>Why this Ado, e≈øpecially with Chri≈øtians in a Church way? for in the Magi≈øtratick order ≈øurely he may (however he will) enforce, not prophaning the day he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points as afore≈øaid; and though they onely of his opinion keep it regularly, yet none of any opinion ≈øhall de≈øpi≈øe it and him irregularly, and if they do and go unpuni≈øhed, be a≈ø≈øured the Magi≈øtrate is in the greate≈øt fault, he is or loo≈øe, or lazy, or both.</p>
                     <p>So for maintenance in this way, the Magi≈øtrate may clearly ≈øetle it and ought, (and that onely from a publike maintenance) for otherwi≈øe his people will grow pure bea≈øts in the form and ≈øhape of men; and to the≈øe he ought to ≈øetle a main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance competent; for humane indu≈øtry is capable of humane ≈øatisfaction; this as Teachers; but as Pa≈øtors, let the additionall maintenance be as Chri≈øtian duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
                     <p>Now to ≈øetle it as Tythes, were the What, and how, and where, and when, and to whom well ≈øetled, it cannot be unlawfull, that is to give a tenth; but to admit it as of duty to the Mini≈øter as to the Prie≈øt, to plead cu≈øtomes of and for Tything, as well as to deny cu≈øtomes of not Tything, are all equally ab≈øurd, if throughly ≈øcanned; A maintenance, and that onely, is agreed due by all to them that Labour in the word and Doctrine; but the whole Mini≈øtery hath with us been ≈øo Generally corrupted, that not onely men have made or pretended con≈øcience to pay any Tythes to ≈øuch wolves in ≈øheepes Cloathing, but from the vanity, wickedne≈øs and perver≈øne≈øs of the≈øe men of corrupt minds, have que≈øtioned whither a mini≈øtry be.</p>
                     <p>Here is a hard task for the Magi≈øtrate; for he hath been nece≈ø≈øitated to take that power into his hands, which at fir≈øt him≈øelf que≈øtioned whither it were lawfull for him or not, but attempting and finding no danger pre≈øent, the fear is now lea≈øt he ≈øhould not let go his hold.</p>
                     <p>I pre≈øume this is clear, he may and will declare if he have any Religion, which he approves; this is mo≈øt naturall; that he will e≈øtabli≈øh what he con≈øents not to, who can per≈øwade him≈øelf of it? all that I can ≈øay is, if he be a Chri≈øtian, let him with all meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and in the evidence of truth by all Chri≈øtian means labour to win all, but to enforce none but the wicked and di≈øobedient to ju≈øt and righteous Lawes; The want of which is the great di≈øgu≈øt of all good men: but I ≈øhall not enlarge here of that.</p>
                     <p>The Churches power then con≈øi≈øting principally, if not wholly, in things plain and evident, it is mo≈øt certain that the Magi≈øtrates Power in ordinary ought not to ≈øtretch ≈øo high, much le≈øs exceed; that is to help where that with humane thoughts ≈øeems to come ≈øhort, as the Church hath hitherto held;</p>
                     <p>Now in this I ≈øhall ≈øpeak one word to the great and weighty con≈øideration of the Supremacy of power, and whither, and how, there be, or may be Two Supreams, which will a little clear up the way for amity among≈øt ≈øo called Chri≈øtians of all opinions.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt we mu≈øt con≈øider the ri≈øe of the controver≈øie is from the word of God in all the new Te≈øtament, wherein all words of ≈øaving knowledge are directed ≈øoly, wholy and onely to the Elect, Saints at lea≈øt by calling and profe≈ø≈øion (which in their ≈øea≈øon ≈øome think, nay beleeve ≈øhall govern the world) and at the≈øe as called out of the way of the world, to a more holy and ≈øpirituall ≈øerving of him.</p>
                     <p>Now ≈øome ≈øuppo≈øe this was to be done onely in a Church way, which both Papi≈øt, Greek Church and Prote≈øtants of all ≈øides agree, that is, that the Magi≈øtrate Ruling among Chri≈øtians in ordinary ought to be a Chri≈øtian.</p>
                     <p>Now ≈øaith the Church of Rome, and all, as a Chri≈øtian he mu≈øt be a member of ≈øome vi≈øible Church; if ≈øo, he mu≈øt be ≈øubordinate to the Pope, and a generall Councell ≈øaith the Pope; to a generall Councell and Fathers of the Church, lay the Biblers of old: To a generall Councell and the Kirke, ≈øay both the Lutheran and Calvini≈øtical Divines; All which, place the Power of the Church Authoritatively in the Officers or Officer Supream.</p>
                     <p>Now tho≈øe of the Congregational way of all ≈øorts di≈øtingui≈øh as the re≈øt do.</p>

                     <p>Fir≈øt in that the Supream Magi≈øtrates are men, and ≈øo members of Churches, they are Subject to the Di≈øcipline of the re≈øpective Congregations and Churches, but as Magi≈øtrates they are di≈øtinct Officers in the world for the good of all men, and the peaceable and quiet Governing of tho≈øe committed by God to their charge.</p>
                     <p>Now as a member, he is inferior to the whole; And as a man he is Subject to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; But as a Prince, he is not Subject to the Church; for as the Prince cannot as Prince perform the Offices of a Pa≈øtor:</p>
                     <p>So neither can the Pa≈øtor, Officers of one or more Churches, intermeddle with the ruling power of the Prince as a Pa≈øtor or Church Officers, in any of their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>Now for Supremacy, they who are Chri≈øtian Princes and Pa≈øtors, will not ≈øtrive for the Supremacy of Power, but keep their fixt places. All Saints are now the Kings, Prie≈øts, and Prophets of the mo≈øt High God; But more e≈øpecially the chief Magi≈øtrate in Ruling repre≈øents the Kingly Office of the Lord Chri≈øt, and the Pa≈øtors and teachers the Prie≈øtly and Prophetical.</p>
                     <p>The Prince Governs the Commonwealth according to the Judiciall Law of the Almighty God, the Law of pure righteou≈øne≈øs laid forth in both the Te≈øtaments; And the Pa≈øtors and Teachers and Elders Govern the Church in di≈øpencing the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Rules of the Go≈øpel: the Pa≈øtor principally if not only in Preaching of the Doctrinall part of Chri≈øtianitie; the brethren appointed to teach, in opening the practicall part of Chri≈øtianitie.</p>
                     <p>I know that ≈øome hold, that all ought to come under the pure notion of Church Government, and all Magi≈øtrates to Rule as Church Officers; I allow it fit to be Queried; but I pre≈øume it is the wickedne≈øs of our pre≈øent age blinds our eyes, that we ≈øee not all that all of them who pretend to ≈øinceritie de≈øire; And I ≈øee not, notwith≈øtanding our variety of opinions, but that all that have not the mark of the bea≈øt, ≈øhall ≈øit down with <hi>Abraham, I≈øaac and Jacob,</hi> in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>By this it is plain there is in the Church of Chri≈øt, the Lord Chri≈øts Sub≈øtitutes in Governing the Nations by the materiall ≈øword according to a Law of righteou≈øne≈øs, and Ju≈øtice, which man may comprehend.</p>
                     <p>And there is the Lord Chri≈øts Sub≈øtitutes in holding forth to the ≈øeverall Churches the Go≈øpel of Love; the one hath the ≈øword of Ju≈øtice, the other that of the Spirit.</p>

                     <p>It will be thought that this admitting of the Prince ≈øubject as a member, will make his power ≈øub≈øervient to the end of that particular Congregation to which he is a≈ø≈øociated; And this will breed Emulation, and at la≈øt divi≈øion; Now let this throughly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered in the cau≈øe original; and the head of this fountain of bitterne≈øs being ≈øtopped, the ≈øtreams it is hoped will be dried up.</p>

                     <p>Now this Arrow came not only out of the Popes quiver, but ≈øecular ≈øo called Princes, after he began, followed, till at length the Abbyes, Mona≈øtaries, Fryeries, &amp;c. had, abounding in riches, and thereby abounding in ea≈øe, growing Luxurious and ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beyond belief, fulfilled the mea≈øure of their iniquities; and <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. was the in≈øtrument as afore≈øaid to plague them, who yet looking rather at Lucre and Power temporall, then Religious duty, did not return the Benefices and Tythes into the Ancient cour≈øe, but conveyed them ≈øtill along to the owners of the Lands of tho≈øe Mona≈øteries, &amp;c. to which they were annexed as they are ≈øtill continued.</p>
                     <p>Now as many had ≈øuch things by particular grant, ≈øo others held them, and ≈øome other onely by pre≈øcription; but the not doing of three or four things, makes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation difficult.</p>

                     <p>Next the not ordering all Annexations and Impropriations into the Common ≈øtock, for the maintenance of teachers Humane and Divine.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly the di≈øcharging of all pre≈øcriptions, cu≈øtomes, Grants, &amp;c. of particular pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of old, either of places, times or per≈øons.</p>
                     <p>La≈øtly, the ≈øetling one Law weight, mea≈øure and tenure preci≈øely throughout the Nation. Now to ≈øpeak one word of pre≈øcription, I take it to be but only the continued Right of a particular per≈øon, or family, or now of a Corporation, Town≈øhip, &amp;c. So that upon due and full ≈øearch, it ≈øeems to me no more then a cu≈øtome in many places and ca≈øes.</p>
                     <p>Now for this, the time of pre≈øcription ought to be ≈øet certain; next the ≈øame ought after once pleaded, to be ≈øetled and publi≈øhed ju≈øt as a cu≈øtome, ≈øo that no publike Right may not be publikely known, and the Ju≈øtice of it owned; for many pre≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are as unju≈øt as many cu≈øtomes, and equally to be di≈øallowed, as ari≈øing upon fal≈øe grounds, evil in them≈øelves, or tending to the dammage of the publike.

                     <head>What Law the Chri≈øtian Magi≈øtrate ought to ≈øettle.</head>
                     <p>THis I ≈øuppo≈øe many will accompt a needle≈øs quaere, both in re≈øpect that the law judicial generally is formerly a≈ø≈øerted requi≈øite to be the head law, and al≈øo a forme or kinde of ≈øetled proceeding in law, agreed to be principally according to the rea≈øon of the common law ≈øo called of the Nation, herein laid down as grounded on the word of God.</p>
                     <p>But my intent is a little to di≈øcu≈øs the rights of the ≈øo called common law, and civil Law, and whither it be fit to allow ≈øuch divers courts of ≈øo called divers laws, and to ≈øearch ≈øhortly whether they were originally one and the ≈øame, or not, which I really ≈øuppo≈øe they were; for it is evident that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the fir≈øt writers of our laws u≈øe not the forme of words of the civil law, dividing the law into the tomes of the <hi>Dige≈øt,</hi> the <hi>Code,</hi> the <hi>Authentick,</hi> and the <hi>Feuds;</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet the rule of <hi>Ju≈øtinians</hi> In≈øtitutes which are an epitome of the Dige≈øt, is by them wholly ob≈øerved.</p>
                     <p>Now the Dige≈øt or Pandect, that is the new called In≈øtitutes (for they are various in names) I agree to be but the drawing of the multitude of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular opinions and judgements of many venerable ≈øages of the Law into one ≈øetled body of Law, containing variety of learning, upon particular Titles of law or head laws, which laws being grown exceeding voluminous and intricate, the Engli≈øh neglected them; and few being learned, they were under the ≈øword di≈øpen≈øed with, and politiquely brought into the Clo≈øet of the Conquerors brea≈øt; and as the condition of the Nation required, were enlarged or ≈øtreightned at plea≈øure: And upon intere≈øt only, the municipal law or cu≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Law of the people was by ≈øome ≈øetled in oppo≈øition to the ≈øo called civil Law.</p>
                     <p>Now this intere≈øt was partly of Princes, who found the Civilian ≈øtill to draw ≈øtrongly towards the advancement of Papall intere≈øt; partly of the practizer, who hereby ≈øiding with the Prince, at la≈øt drew the Civilian into a narrow room, and got the name of common lawyer, as ≈øtudious of that law which was u≈øed and received among the people by tradition generally, and in time they got preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and liberties as we have ≈øeen e≈øtabli≈øhed.</p>
                     <p>We have known the great ≈øtrifes that have been in the≈øe courts not out of con≈øcience of the intere≈øt of ju≈øtice to be either more faithfuly, or more ≈øpeedily, and at a due rate executed, but to bring gri≈øt to the Mill, as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters glory was to have a multitude of Auditors, no matter how few Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they would but ≈øcan his Doctrine, que≈øtion his life, and unle≈øs he were more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, ≈øcruple adding more to his former abundance.</p>
                     <p>So the≈øe mens honor, was, to have their courts packed with ≈øutors, that the ≈øeveral practi≈øer from the Judge to the dore-keeper might have his Fee; from the≈øe ≈øhifts grew the ≈øo called prohibitions, con≈øultations, &amp;c. And the poor Sutor was undone, while the Courts admitted Fir≈øt with ea≈øe the Quaere, and then eagerly pro≈øecuted their own dues and rights before his could be determined, which was ever ≈ølow paced enough.</p>
                     <p>This evidences the nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øetled Fees in all places, and that from the ≈øupream Magi≈øtrate; This al≈øo clears the ca≈øe that the ≈øupream Magi≈øtrate mu≈øt admit but one Law in practice and proceeding, nor one ≈øort of Lawyers; he may for the advance of learning order the ≈øtudy of it in Latin and all the exerci≈øes.</p>
                     <p>But the practi≈øe all ought a≈ø≈øuredly to be in the vulgar tongue of the Nation, and in that tongue to be con≈øtantly printed, and al≈øo all precepts and proce≈ø≈øes of the Courts what≈øoever; for the pure executing of ju≈øtice is more to be eyed then humane learning; For as in the Eccle≈øia≈øtick State, when the ordinances of men and unction of men are preferred above, and ju≈øtle out the ordinances and unction of the Lord, the Church is Apo≈øtate:</p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:105181:110"/>
                     <p>So when intere≈øts overtop ju≈øtice, and ju≈øtice and righteou≈øne≈øs are become Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Topical heads, Hypocritical Colours to wilder the people, the State is al≈øo A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtate; and as long as either of the≈øe work in Church or State, the Apo≈øtacy, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ruining Antichri≈øtian Apo≈øtacy reigns.</p>
                     <p>Therefore all the Courts of a well con≈øtituted Nation, a Nation that ≈øeeks the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and freedome of her people indeed, mu≈øt have a body of Law proper to the Nation, and this mu≈øt as before, be ≈øo ≈øetled, that every Subject may in due ju≈øt and evident way partake the benefit of it; therefore it mu≈øt all be common, and keep that name, that weak ones may not be offended, what law ≈øoever be ≈øetled; for it is mo≈øt properly belonging to the Community.</p>
                     <p>La≈øtly, admit as little form as may be, yet I would ≈øettle the habits of Judges and practizers in all Courts, but by way of honor; for I intend but this one word, the glory of form is lo≈øt where form is made Common, Scarlet, the ornament of Judges is the guard of a Groom in the≈øe daies.</p>

                     <p>IN a word this is the plain inlet to all corruption; admit this and your ≈øetlement mu≈øt totter; to di≈øtingui≈øh betwixt judicial places and other, is but to hook in a liberty to unlawful things by degrees; for all are officers tending to the execution of Ju≈øtice, and it is unju≈øt to pay too much, and to ≈øtay too long for ju≈øtice, as well as to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied ju≈øtice, or have fal≈øe ju≈øtice; Admit ≈øuch practi≈øes, and all eva≈øions of Law will be not only ≈øtudied but practi≈øed; one evill admitted, a thou≈øand follow.</p>
                     <p>That ju≈øt and hone≈øt and wi≈øemen have done it, and do it, is not worth the while; the ≈øhort an≈øwer is, there is no man but errs, And ≈øoone≈øt in matters of intere≈øt, much more where cu≈øtome ≈øignes the lawfulnes of it; but a word to what makes it ≈øeem lawful.</p>
                     <p>Suppo≈øe the place be eighteen hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> accompted, as the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celours was in the late Kings time; and Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> pay ≈øo much annually, <hi>viz.</hi> Two thou≈øand pound to Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Two thou≈øand to Lord <hi>Au.</hi> and at la≈øt hath four or five thou≈øand pound a year only to him≈øelf.</p>
                     <p>So the Prothonotary of the Common Pleas to pay eleven thou≈øand pounds for his place, and have eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen hundred or two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand pounds a year, had he not better have had it freely, and only five hundred, then if he had died within a year, left his only daughter a beggar, and his Friends engaged only to purcha≈øe a more then nece≈ø≈øary allowance? I could ≈øet down who had this money, how it was ≈øhared, unle≈øs wi≈øe and hone≈øt men then mi≈øinformed me.</p>
                     <p>By this it is clear, that there may be a ≈øufficiency to ≈øettle the intere≈øts of the ≈øupream Magi≈øtrate, if they have wi≈øe and hone≈øt men to carry on the work, upon founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of certain Ju≈øtice, and pay every officer, and the Supream Magi≈øtrate to be a gainer, however no loo≈øer, but the people to be ≈øurely advantaged in the ju≈øt proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and I≈ø≈øue of their litigations.</p>
                     <p>Now for the choice of Officers it is ≈øetled before; both in the qualification hone≈øt and skilled; and in due manner approved; and in places of many Officers, where aptne≈øs is by the cour≈øe of ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, if no objection bee, is mo≈øt plau≈øible, but not to be tied to it.</p>
                     <p>Now the way to have good Officers, is to ≈øettle eminently ju≈øt Judges; and to gain them, is not to have too many; and in yong States or beginnings this is of ab≈øolute neee≈ø≈øity; for without it ruine is unavoidable.</p>

                     <head>The nece≈ø≈øity of educating Sea-men, and the way of breeding them, and from that of the Politique Law to re≈øtrain eating of Fle≈øh.</head>
                     <p>THis quere is of great concernment to This Nation and I≈øland; God is our ≈øupport; but the means which the Lord affords us, are not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in the fir≈øt place we ≈øhall look at the way of encrea≈øing, and breeding Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners.</p>
                     <p>I ≈øuppo≈øe it is clear to mo≈øt intelligent men, that by the fi≈øhery, there by long being abroad in ≈øtormy ≈øea≈øons, and high Seas, whither great gain invites them, they become not only inured to the Sea, but grow hardned and dreadle≈øs, their experience being much more then either a Merchant or man of War can atchieve; So that where they breed one able Mariner, a poor North Sea-man breeds Ten. And indeed from the≈øe are your great Ships manned.</p>
                     <p>I mu≈øt therefore be the care of the Supream Magi≈øtrate e≈øpecially to provide for even the≈øe.</p>
                     <p>The fir≈øt care is that they may fi≈øh ≈øafely, therefore the convoy ought to be ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
                     <p>Next when they come home, there mu≈øt be vent for the fi≈øh; The ob≈øtacle is the old ≈øuper≈øtition of the Lent, or the Forty dayes fa≈øt: the ju≈øt and prudent Magi≈øtrate can ea≈øily remedy this, by making it Twenty eight or Thirty daies.</p>
                     <p>There is an objection or two again≈øt the ≈øea≈øon.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt religious or ≈øo ≈øuppo≈øed, ju≈øt before Ea≈øter, and carries the time of ≈øuper≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ≈øetle it to begin upon a certain day of the Month yearly and that ≈øcruple is gone.</p>
                     <p>The next is Phy≈øical: then is the return of the year, and our bodies which ≈øhould then receive be≈øt nouri≈øhment, are filled by fi≈øh with cold and flatulent nouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this may ≈øeem much to ≈øome, but it is not worth the while: for ≈øuppo≈øe there were nor fle≈øh nor fi≈øh, there is variety of meats to live on for a month in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I ≈øuppo≈øe two daies in a week truly ob≈øerved to have no fle≈øh ≈øpent were better; for ≈øee how Lent was kept: lay in ≈øo much fle≈øh before as ≈øerved the hou≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; And ≈øo it would be, ye will ≈øay, for two dayes in a week; I agree it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ≈øay truly ob≈øerved: therefore as in the hi≈øtorical part I propound that the rea≈øon of every law be divulged, and con≈øcience from conviction of the benefit of it engaged to obedience, and no way like that, as the examples of Catholique ab≈øtinence now manife≈øt.</p>
                     <p>But if the Magi≈øtrate would u≈øe force, I ≈øhall offer the be≈øt and mo≈øt rea≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable way, which is to ≈øend to every hou≈øehold in every town ≈øo many fi≈øh at an equal and ≈øet rate by him, according to the number of his family, ≈øo many fi≈øh for every head by the year, accompting two daies in the week wholly for fi≈øh.</p>
                     <p>Now the benefit of the pre≈øervation of yong Cattell, is great and warily to be provided for: therefore let the Magi≈øtrate enact, that all Lambe killed before ≈øuch a day ≈øhall be forfeited, and the killer and eater to forfeit a price.</p>
                     <p>So no Chicken, Turky, Duck or Goo≈øe till ≈øuch an age, no Rabbit till Mid≈øommer; And that in Two great re≈øpects.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, till that time they bear little grouth, and do not much harme if well looked too.</p>
                     <p>Secondly the wool and skin is then ≈øerviceable.</p>
                     <p>Now for Calves, the laws for rearing of yong Cattell mu≈øt be made in
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:105181:111"/> them more certain; for Bull Calves needs not in many places to be pre≈øerved equally as others; ≈øome al≈øo are plainly unfit for to be reared, at lea≈øt by opinion; Therefore there mu≈øt be a loo≈øe to them more then others.</p>
                     <p>But to ≈øetle all, to provide that every ≈øecond, third, fourth or fifth Calfe be reared up, or ≈øo much paid to the hayward of the Town; And every Town to have one, ≈øeems ea≈øie and feazible.</p>

                     <p>No, it is intended in Que≈øtions doubtful, troubling the peace of the Churches of God.</p>
                     <p>Now it is plain, by what hath been ≈øaid before, that the latitude of the Magi≈øtrates power in the≈øe ca≈øes, is only the pre≈øervation of the publick Peace; otherwi≈øe he hath but the relation of a private Chri≈øtian.</p>

                     <p>Again, for the Churches to de≈øire the Magi≈øtrates permi≈ø≈øion, and after to enforce a Grant, or ≈øummon without, was a greater fault; for their profe≈ø≈øion admits le≈øs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation; ju≈øt Magi≈øtrates will not deny the Churches lawful meetings, while the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ≈øeek but lawful things lawfully.</p>
                     <p>Now as the Churches have the fir≈øt in≈øight, as by Office, into Church Errors, it is their duty to con≈øult a remedy; and if a meeting of ≈øome few Churches, yea be it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall, ≈øhall be required, till error ari≈øe, it may not be unlawfull; they have the Right.</p>
                     <p>But if the Magi≈øtrate upon error ≈øettle a Law to prevent that error, (further the Magi≈øtrate ought not to go, and ≈øo far he may) then the Churches ought to ob≈øerve that Law; But in ca≈øe of Error, or ≈øuch Conventions as are po≈ø≈øibly dangerous to the Civil Peace, the Supream Magi≈øtrate ought to be advi≈øed, and ought to be obeyed, if di≈ø≈øenting, yea though his di≈ø≈øent be not in ≈øome eyes well grounded; for this evil is the lea≈øt, however experience hath manife≈øted in a ≈øuper≈øtitious Age the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man prevailes, in a ≈øwording the Magi≈øtrate.</p>
                     <p>What I have written, may to many ≈øeem doubtful, to whom the power of Right belongs.</p>
                     <p>But the plain meaning is this; This being a Church-Affair, an A≈ø≈øembly for the ≈øettlement of con≈øcience, it is the proper work of the Churches.</p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:105181:112"/>
                     <p>And if the Churches have power over one the other, as in the Popi≈øh, Epi≈øcopal, and Presbyterian way; the Summons ought <hi>De jure</hi> to move from the Church, but the Magi≈øtrate may prohibit, and ought to be obeyed; but divers Churches di≈ø≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this in fact, cau≈øed fir≈øt an addre≈øs to the Imperial Power, and ≈øo it would do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; al≈øo the very Congregating ≈øuch Members into one place, ought, both for the ≈øafety of them that meete, and the place where they meete, and of the whole State, to be not onely with the knowledge, but the approbation of the Supream Magi≈øtrate; and the rather, for that though tho≈øe elected ought to go, yet no Chri≈øtian may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred; this in that way, and in the Congregational way more clearly will a≈ø≈øure, that though the bu≈øine≈øs be a Church bu≈øine≈øs, and concerning matters of meer con≈øcience: yet the great matter, is, as they are men, to con≈øult of difficulties and this is the Church-work; and therefore the Magi≈øtrate ought not to pre≈øcribe the Chri≈øtians met what to propound.</p>
                     <p>For I pre≈øume, That ought to be long before manife≈øted; fir≈øt, in the private Congregation, then in the adjoyning Churches, yea, in publike Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>There is another part of the Quaere, that is, Whether the Magi≈øtrate may ≈øummon without the Churches prayer?</p>
                     <p>Now as to the right, a≈ø≈øuredly as a Father of the Country principally intru≈øted for the good, welfare, and peace of his people, and as a Chri≈øtian taking notice of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chri≈øtian Controver≈øies, he may invite a≈ø≈øembling the Churches, and may require it, but ought not enforce untill the civil Peace be actually di≈øturbed; he leaves the ≈øin at their door. This root of bitterne≈øs aro≈øe from thoughts of the nece≈ø≈øity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying what was ami≈øs, and venturing all for that, which is true and fal≈øe: A fal≈øe colour of truth with a real mi≈øtake; the Magi≈øtrate cannot enforce here; the Church mu≈øt have its due liberty here; otherwi≈øe we mu≈øt admit by the Rule of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, the like power to the Church again≈øt the Magi≈øtrate offending.</p>
                     <p>No, let each keep their place, and if the Magi≈øtrate will amend the Church, let it be by Preaching, not fighting; let them come that will upon his call, let him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade the other, not enforce actually (politickly he may) no not though all that come agree with him.</p>
                     <p>But I am confident, Take away the intere≈øt of Power and Revenue, and the Spring of all the≈øe controver≈øies will be dried up; for the matter is clear in it ≈øelf, and by mo≈øt ≈øo agreed.</p>
                     <p>I could enlarge much in this, and all the heads that I have treated on.</p>
                     <p>I could have multiplied Quaeries to delight the Ear, and make the Book more Merchantable in this Age; I could have ≈øcattered witty varieties, Recorded old Hi≈øtories, and enterwoven new Stories, to have delighted a foeminine fancy; I could have ≈øo poli≈øhed my phra≈øe, and trimmed my di≈øcour≈øe, that it ≈øhould have ≈øtoln a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the heart of a light youngling, and like a <hi>Romance</hi> fettered him in a clew of delights, till he had come to the end of the Book and been never the wi≈øer.</p>
                     <p>But as the fir≈øt thing moved me to this Work, was the ≈øerious apprehen≈øion of the bitter Cup the Lord had put into the hand of the Inhabitants of this Nation to drink, and what God had done in <hi>Germany;</hi> when my ≈øoul con≈øidered the deadly defiances among men ≈øo called Chri≈øtians; not onely Nation again≈øt Nation, but they of the ≈øame Nation one again≈øt the other:</p>
                     <p>When I eyed the Threats and Promi≈øes of the Word of the Eternal God, Revolved his Acts of old, and at pre≈øent done among≈øt us; comparing the Profe≈ø≈øions and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øes of Chri≈øtians; and that though we had light above others, yet our ≈øins were more grievous then others; but mo≈øt of all was my ≈øpirit affected with the many engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which lay upon the Nation; For this light drew from us on all ≈øides, Royal, and Parliamentary, and that under what notion, or name, or opinion ≈øoever you will rank them, Promi≈øes and Vows of ≈øetling Truth and Righteou≈øne≈øs; King, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and People, all ≈øeeing the Errors in Church and State; a bare name, no face, if a foot≈øtep of pure Chri≈øtianity. This in the fir≈øt place put me upon a more ≈øerious way of Writing; and in the ≈øecond place, the multitude of my occa≈øions would not permit the idle time to clip, and pare, and file, when I was forced to ≈øteal time, to ca≈øt and mould the matter of this Di≈øcour≈øe by a quarter of the hour to day, and as
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:105181:112"/> much the next, ≈øeldom an hour together, and then happily not of a week, two, or three, ≈øometimes not of a moneth after; This will render me to a wi≈øe man over zealous, and over-confident, to ru≈øh ≈øo unadvi≈øedly into ≈øuch a great undertaking as it doth attempt the holding forth, though but in E≈ø≈øay, the frame of a Civil Chri≈øtian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and they that know me will ≈øay,</p>
                     <p>Have ≈øo many Ages pa≈ø≈øed? Are ≈øo many wi≈øe men at pre≈øent? And none to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it, but one ≈øo young, a man not able for time to have dige≈øted in any part the voluminous Tracts, which he that but offers at ≈øuch an E≈ø≈øay ought to have gone through; and to do all this <hi>raptim,</hi> and that by ≈ønatches, which required the mo≈øt ≈øerious thoughts.</p>
                     <p>La≈øtly, A man that practi≈øed the Law of <hi>England</hi> ≈øo ≈øhort a while, that he could not comprehend the Ambages of it; and for eminency of parts, a man of no Renown, the world hath not taken notice of him.</p>
                     <p>I know this, as to others, will be the whi≈øpers and ≈øpeakings concerning Me, and this Work; It is not pre≈øumption of my Abilities, nor to gain applau≈øe that I adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon this Work; my heart was fired within me, when after ≈øo many reiterated undertakings for Righteou≈øne≈øs, Ju≈øtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ≈øaw the VVork ≈øo far off from perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that it was wor≈øe then before.</p>
                     <p>I waited, attended, hoped, prayed, and all, yea incited men able, and skilled in the Laws of the Land, by long ≈øtudy, and approved parts: They agreed Error in the whole, a nece≈ø≈øity of Reformation, and that even by a Tran≈øub≈øtantiation not Con≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantiation; for they agreed the whole Law was, as it is, devolved into Form and Practi≈øe; the pure ≈øtreams of Ju≈øtice, were as they fell from the fountain of Divine and Moral Rea≈øon, drawn by Art into private Ci≈øterns of Profit and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                     <p>But they dur≈øt not undertake the VVork.</p>
                     <p>I de≈øired then, con≈øidering my many occa≈øions, That they would but impart ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to me, to help me in my ≈øo great attempt; I talked with ≈øome Attorneys to the ≈øame purpo≈øe; and from two men I received two Papers, ≈øhewing the abu≈øe of dammage clear and ≈øuing out the <hi>Cap. utlagats,</hi> the mo≈øt ordinary matters.</p>
                     <p>I then addre≈ø≈øed my ≈øelf to ≈øome men eminent in Honor, and places of Tru≈øt; di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered my minde; we argued; I ≈øaw they were convinced of the truth of the thing, and were re≈øolved, were the Law altered, they ≈øhould ≈øubmit, yea even to what I then and here propounded.</p>
                     <p>But they would have no hand in it; they had no time, they had ≈øpent their Studies in the pre≈øent Law, and to change was a new work; Some advi≈øed me to leave off the≈øe thoughts, and fall to Practi≈øe, they would warrant me I ≈øhould get as much as any of them; After long delayes, con≈øulting my own ≈øtrength, and ≈øeeing Judges, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants, Councellors, Attorneys, Solicitors, and All, confe≈ø≈øed Alteration nece≈ø≈øary, delayes evident, Ju≈øtice incertain, Equity more ruining then undoing Common Law.</p>
                     <p>I did partly out of the ≈øence of the unju≈øtne≈øs and wickedne≈øs of the Law, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally that I might be out of the la≈øh of a credit Ruining frown, leave all Practi≈øe what≈øoever, as I had formerly left the mo≈øt, and did con≈øult which way to take to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the mo≈øt Chri≈øtian way, the Evils of the Apo≈øtate State, and Commonwealth; and how to offer an expedient ≈øutable to the condition of the people wedded to Laws and Cu≈øtoms called their own.</p>
                     <p>This is that which the Lord put me upon; I have avoided to my utmo≈øt all bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and ju≈øt occa≈øion of offence to any, either Powers, or per≈øons: And to any man ≈øhall require a further account of the hope that is in me concerning matter of Con≈øcience, or of the matter of Law, and the Rea≈øons herein offered, ≈øo it be with Chri≈øtian meekne≈øs and zeal for the Truth, according to my knowledge, I ≈øhall freely di≈øcover my ≈øelf, and yield I hope, a ≈øatisfactory an≈øwer.</p>
                     <p>For I a≈ø≈øert, there is nothing here laid down in any kind, as to the civil Regiment, not warranted by the pre≈øent (≈øo called) Law-books of <hi>England;</hi> I re≈øtrain not my ≈øelf to the ≈øo called Year-Books.</p>
